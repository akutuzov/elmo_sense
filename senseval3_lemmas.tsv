she national gallery choice of picture be example of problem pos to artist by colour , and in a video talk she demonstrate how this artistic problem have be solve . connections with she own practice as a painter be evident , even though she abstract composition be very different in subject from the work of she chose artist , who include veronis and poussin . she	argument	be that the subject of the old master painting could be disregard by a painter who wish to find lesson for the present in the artistic practice of the past . bridget riley have no intention of either present an account of poussin 's aim and procedure , or of demonstrat veronis 's debt to he predecessor in venetian art , as a historian would have feel a duty to do . the artist as critic in this case deliberately avoid the historical context of the picture she be discuss .
if a critic have a very decided political or religious point of view , this can override other consideration in judgement about art ; the viewpoint may also give a bias to the description or interpretation make . a remarkable marxist interpretation , for example , be make of florentine paint from giotto 's time to the fifteen century , by frederick antal in the 1940 . late writer , even that sympathetic to antal 's thesis , have admit that the	argument	about class conflict in the period be exaggerat , but this do not exclude the possibility that an equally unexpected approach may not throw light on some apparently exhausted topic . of course , a theorist may damage an argument through bias , perhaps exclud relevant evidence inconvenient to the case be make ; but this be not a danger exclusive to theorist . omission be much patent perhaps in survey make with a political bias .
a remarkable marxist interpretation , for example , be make of florentine paint from giotto 's time to the fifteen century , by frederick antal in the 1940 . late writer , even that sympathetic to antal 's thesis , have admit that the argument about class conflict in the period be exaggerat , but this do not exclude the possibility that an equally unexpected approach may not throw light on some apparently exhausted topic . of course , a theorist may damage an	argument	through bias , perhaps exclud relevant evidence inconvenient to the case be make ; but this be not a danger exclusive to theorist . omission be much patent perhaps in survey make with a political bias . we have already mention in pass the state policy regard the art in germany , the ussr and china ; there have be swrite who follow the party line by give attention to that artist favoure by patronage , while neglect other .
as in book on the philosophy of art , or aesthetics , many do not in fact contain any art criticism , in the sense of description , interpretation and judgement of individual work . they strength be rather in cleare the ground of preconceive idea about the art , and put new point of view . when work of art be descri only that aspect of an image important to the	argument	be inclu . it be in this arena that some of the fierce intellectual fight about art be take place , though the contest range wide than the visual art to politics and economic . for example , chadwick state : there can be no simple category define as feminist art history , since the effect of new idea be that much recend scholarly write have shift attention from the category art and artist to broad issue concern ideology of gender , sexuality , and power .
they may , however , not be exactly what the author would have prefer , as a colour plate which be readily available ( perhaps have be use in another publication ) be much cheaper to use than a new plate which have to be commission . the reader can thus be aware that a write may have write round what happen to have be offer . this may be important in assesse how well a write illustrate an	argument	. the standard which can be obtain in colour reproduction today be high , but not always attain . comparison of illustration of the same picture in several publication will demonstrate this truism , while the good test of look at a reproduction in front of the picture it can be a dishearten experience .
in all capitalist democracie there be two source for the legitimacy of the state , namely statehand it and the ideology specific to the state in question . it will be argue that when the second source be threaten as well as the first , the power to coerce can devolve on the civil sphere in a substantive way . the conclusion to the	argument	will be that there be a specific form of violence of a political kind outside of state control which cannot be reduce to crime . the specificity of this form of violence or coercion have to be recognize , however one feel about the terrible consequence of it for the innocent . this form of political violence require political answer and not just an anti - criminal , police - orient , coercive response .
covenant theology it empower the people to take action against the state in certain and specific circumstance , and ian paisley and many of he supporter both within and without the orange order have frequently use bully - boy tactics , and appro paramilitary procession , marche , and drill . from carson to paisley one find the argument that it be legitimate to fight to regain one 's fundamental freedom if the sovereign with who one have covenant one 's allegiance betray that allegiance and conduct one into slavery . the	argument	be clearly inspire by a religious motivation and show ulster protestantism to be a vigorous form of political religion , approve whatever defensive measure be necessary to avoid submission to rome rule . ulster protestantism be not contain within church but spill out on to the street . religion be also involve in the violence indirect .
perhaps the much reveale aspect of the whole affair be the way dr browne handle it . the member of he party appeare to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the early bill , and dr browne only find out in october/november 1950 . when he be tell of the hierarchy 's opposition to any bill of this kind , dr browne , he secularly inclin , submit he proposal and	argument	to the hierarchy for approval , just as a previous health minister , dr walsh , have consult archbishop mcquaid on a similar matter in 1946 . if a man of such convictions feel it necessary to follow this course , how much very would have he religiously devoted colleague . in fact , he cabinet colleague , already unsure about public support for the bill and alienate from dr browne by he provocative politics , be not prepare to go against the hierarchy 's condemnation and refuse to support the proposal .
but they do and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation . in addition , the clergy appear to have considerable difficulty in recognize the transformation which theoretical position on christian belief and morality undergo as they be concretize in historical human relationship , doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in they perception of socio - ethical issue . part of the overall	argument	of this book be that , as the roman catholic church be principal validator or legitimator of the southern state along with the concept of the national entity , what that state go on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separate out from the responsibility of the church . this structural link between politics and religion be underline by the legitimacy the church give to the state as a whole , by recognize it simply as society . however , it be the further legitimation give to a particular socio - ethical form of political religion in the constitution and to the implied authority of religious intellectual in decide in concreto what must be take by the state as in the interest of the common good which give to conflict in ireland between the two alliance it political religious dimension in the sphere of law .
this last be soon replace , on 9 may , by a much specific and high organize pressure group heade by many who have previously mount the pro - life anti - abortion campaign . of particular importance to the anti - divorce campaign be a lawyer , william binchy , who have already produce a book in 1984 on the subject . large publicity campaign begin and the irish time also lent it weight to the pro - divorce	argument	, campaign in it column until the eve of the referendum in late june . though the coalition government be allow they tds the irish equivalent for mp a free vote on the issue , it party , fine gael and labour , officially sponsore the campaign for the constitutional change . fianna fil appear to be equally divide on the issue .
this be the line already adopt by binchy ( 1984 ) who interpret world - wide statistics in this direction . divorce be see to be harder on the woman than the man , who could get out of they family responsibility so much very easily with divorce than without it . in oppose the	argument	marshall by the anti - divorce group , the pro - divorce group argue that , despite the existence of divorce legislation in northern ireland , there be still a low divorce rate . the period of separation in undefended case be two year , and five year have to run if one of the party oppose the divorce . that man in particular do not benefit from the procedure be suggest by the fact that twice as many woman as man fil for divorce .
one might be forgive for think that the bishop letter have something to do with it and that haughey be intent on construct an alliance between that heed the teaching of the hierarchy and the party faithful . in early may , two - third of fianna fil td from the west have already indicate they would campaign in they constituency against the amendment ( irish time , 2 may 1986 ) . the wood 's speech also introduce an important new	argument	which may have have some considerable effect on irish voter . it suggest that second marriage would substantially infringe the right of inheritance of the member of the first family . in a society of extremely strong rural , traditional value on right of inheritance , the suggestion that constitutional frankenstein would devour constitutional orphan ( dil debates , 14 may 1986 ) be clearly calculate to raise a moral panic , have produce the appropriate folk - devil .
the main ground appear to be the danger which it might pose to the small southern protestant minority by encourag mix marriage . however , no evidence favour such a contention have ever be produce . harry macadoo , then the church of ireland archbishop of dublin , on several occasion put forward the	argument	that southern protestant be a minority group with they own culture and traditions , and thus deserve to have school for they in order to hand on they own tradition . when consider the merit of this argument , one do have to bear in mind the particularly precarious nature of the southern protestant group . protestant opposition to integrate schooling be sometimes hear in the north , particularly from the fundamentalist camp , who not only fear catholic infiltration of state school but be oppose to anything other than bible protestantism in religious education .

in the debate over the last twenty year there have be considerable interplay of theological and sociological reason , with social scientist also contribute to paper and discussion . what have be see as an aspect of the roman catholic intellectual opposition to divorce in chapter 5 can also be recognize as a feature of the defence of catholic school too : the opposition contain an interpretation of the moral nature of contemporary society and of what happen to catholic who be not to some degree protect from it . in this write 's view , the	argument	against multi - denominational education and in favour of catholic school support an overall political theology which be strongly base on authority within the church . hierarchy and clergy be see almost to monopolize the teach and wisdo about life . they be both director of soul and minder of the public conscience .
put together with a faith vision of the contemporary social world as inherently secularist and radically subversive of roman catholic value , the combination be significantly reactionary and ethnocentric . the aspect of this political theology will be discuss late . first it be necessary to consider the	argument	use in the public debate . while the argument of the defender of catholic school have a theological basis , that of the promoter of integrate schooling have be founded on what they see to be the result of the present system , namely a violent and destructive society . but there have be some attempt also to undercut the basic level of the defender 's case .
irish bishop have be well aware of spencer 's ( 1968 ) research . use traditional measure of religiosity , he have point out the apparent failure of english catholic school to produce good catholic and few ex - catholic than state or other school , and have infer the likelihood of the same for irish school . spencer 's	argument	have be band about from time to time . this be not unnatural , as in the 1970 and early 1980s spencer be at the queen 's university , belfast , and an active member of the all child together movement . support for this line of approach have be find in greeley and rossi 's ( 1966 ) survey in the usa on the effectiveness of catholic school .
in the light of w . mccready be finding in another study that the religious behaviour of the father have a great impact on child , greeley consider the fact that catholic school be have an increase influence on man to be of significant importance for the future of roman catholicism in the usa ( 1976 : 1735 ) . clearly , the follow - up study be very favourable to the defender of catholic school than to opponent . however , greeley and rossi 's work also have be use to uphold the defender 's	argument	that , though roman catholic school vary in they efficiency , they be certainly good than any possible alternative in term of produce good roman catholic . thus , both side have tend to use social scientific research to make statement in general about catholic school which have be draw from other country and , therefore , beyond the cultural confine within which irish catholic school exist . this be something for which survey , include that of greeley and rossi , be not and cannot be intended .
there be nothing in the study on the difference between individual catholic school , either in term of pupil experience or the variety of educational practice and personnel in each school . a black - box approach to the schooling process be use with no direct investigation of process within the school . final , while it could be argue that greeley and rossi tell we something of catholic versus state school in the us , they have nothing to tell we about catholic versus christian , multi - denominational school , which be what many of the	argument	in ireland be about . but the central and substantive argument that defender of roman catholic school have have to deal with be that the dual school system in northern ireland encourag , support , or at little reinforce the sectarian divide , and that it form part of the vicious circle maintain conflict in ulster . it have be argue that one could help to break that circle by integrat the school system ( fraser 1974 ; heskin 1980 ) .
a black - box approach to the schoole process be use with no direct investigation of process within the school . final , while it could be argue that greeley and rossi tell we something of catholic versus state school in the us , they have nothing to tell we about catholic versus christian , multi - denominational school , which be what many of the argument in ireland be about . but the central and substantive	argument	that defender of roman catholic school have have to deal with be that the dual school system in northern ireland encourag , support , or at little reinforce the sectarian divide , and that it form part of the vicious circle maintain conflict in ulster . it have be argue that one could help to break that circle by integrat the school system ( fraser 1974 ; heskin 1980 ) . a small number of empirical study actual do in northern ireland have be invok in the course of the debate .
consequently , one have to improve relationship within northern ireland without try to merge the entire school system . however , curricular change , joint teach project , and _ great contact be see necessary . roman catholic church leader have use additional local study to refute	argument	which treat roman catholic school as part of the northern problem . they have interpret salter 's study of belfast secondary school as show catholic to be less prejudiced than protestant . even if this be so , the implication have be make by catholic school supporter that catholic school have not promote or reinforce any measure of prejudice , and that no other possible type of school could improve on they ( daly 1975 ) .
they have interpret salter 's study of belfast secondary school as show catholic to be less prejudiced than protestant . even if this be so , the implication have be make by catholic school supporter that catholic school have not promote or reinforce any measure of prejudice , and that no other possible type of school could improve on they ( daly 1975 ) . unfortunately , the necessary link to warran this second conclusion a control group of catholic in a multi - denominational situation be simply not available to salter , and so the	argument	be void . use have also be make of russell 's work on the teaching of civics in northern ireland school . the work lead russell he to conclude that the teaching of the subject have no effect whatsoever on pupil 's political outlook .
then all of a sudden , silence . you keep wait for very but it do not come . he work till lunch , then wander into the kitchen and have long	argument	with tony , or perhaps a discussion about the good way to cook trout or whether or not to sack the gardener . in the afternoon he start by sleep , then take over the kitchen and insist on prepare extravagant five - course meal . have i take he into salisbury to the oculist .
i mean , i expect it be difficult to manage without harm they . no each lady have personal place she cake on the long table without assistance . but then mr clancy and mr venables , who have be stand by to offer encouragement , have fall into an	argument	concern position . mr doran have move he wife 's cake to the first position , and mr clancy have move it back to the middle , say the first cake tast have the good chance , and he wife 's cake would be first as it have get there first . mr venables disagree and make some claim about tastebud and they overstimulation .
that agatha christie 's reading be wide - range cannot now be deny , but , even so , the source of one of hercule poirot 's favourite ploy almost , it could be say , he trademark , the gather together of the suspect at the climax of one of he investigation be surprise . it be only after extensive reade through the writing of many author that i come across the work which undoubted give the author this particular inspiration . here , from a late volume of the scot musical museum , be the poem which clinch i	argument	. though publish anonymously , it be undoubted the work of robert burn : ca ' the burgies tae the boggin chorus .
i put martha 's apron on by accident this morning . she will put a fifty - pound note in it and so she think that it have be stol . when i find it , there be an	argument	and we go for each other . when do you discover you mistake about the apron
however , if you be go to fly solo , refuse be the only sensible thing to do . fly demand all you concentration and it be not wise to risk fly if you have business worry or some other mental stress on you mind . even a violent	argument	will leave you mentally high and quite unfit to fly . you can also become unfit in the air through lack of food and drink . both this factor can cause lack of concentration and apathy .
traditionally in anthropology , the ethnographer have study a social system or culture through a period of intensive participant observation in the field . this have generate considerable concern about the ethnographic experience it , and specifically about the subjective nature of the process . unlike the natural science , where discussion often starts with the result and ignore the methodology of the research , the social science and increase anthropology have develope an elaborate	argument	about the practice of do research . the interpretation of culture and even the ability to understand what be happen in the society under scrutiny as well as the need to grapple with political or ethical question be all littendle and fundamental problem of the moment ( phillip 1973 : 78 ) . mere observation and report be inadequate , give the limit scope of thing which can be truly observe ( holy 1984 : 25 ) .
as social dirt they become an affront to purity and possess the danger of the contagious and impure ( dougla 1966 ) , require they removal from the public vision . as yet there be no other body to undertake this task , and even tentative move to remove the problem from the cell block and into the detoxification centre founder in the entrepreneurial 1980 ; for there be little immediate profit to be make from reclamation of this kind of scrap material ( although the long - term value of a humanitarian return might be think to be well worth pursue in a civilized society ! ) . the	argument	be therefore not about police control or a utopium without control , but to explore why some cultural behaviour have a history of police action and to discover where that behaviou fit into police ideology . it status or ( as important ) it lack of value create complex system of meaning which be rare articulate ; for the police world have similar stricture to that which benedict ( 1967 ) descri in she attempt to understand the rigidity of japanis culture : man who have accept a system of value by which to live , cannot without court in - efficiency and chao keep for long a fence - off portion of they life where they think and behave according to a contrary set of value .
to i senior command and in 1986 i inform i chief officer of the acceptance of i ph.d . these , in accordance with the directive lay down by force order . no one , of course , have ask to read it , for if i	argument	be correct the service have no need of any reminder of how the ideology work or how to implement the paradigm which support they cultural norm . nor do they need they daily practice to be expose to the analytic eye of anthropological thick description , for in they task - driven world there be little to be gain by reflect on what they already live and understand . any need to analyse the way in which the multi - variant police world form a coherent and self - sustain whole be material for the social scientist and not the practitioner , for they already live the system as a matter of course .
a good proportion of we work concern we availability to act as an unacknowledged arm of the social welfare service to drug user in crisis situations , provide a front - line service for the speed freak who be od will on the result of a bent script , or the acid head have a bad trip , for we be in the street , the pub , the club , the crash pad , and communal house frequent by the new alternative society . much of we daily work be ten year in advance of the official police community involvement programmes and yet we action be only an extension of that social welfare activity the police have be heavily involve in for generation , but which be never give status as real police work simply because of the institutional emphasis place upon summon list , number of arrest , crime detection , and other statistical returns . many of we new counter - cultural deviant be articulate and present very cogent	argument	relate to they alleged victimless crime . for example , they would link they cannabis use and an alternative ideology or religious vision to challenge we somewhat static version of social reality . many of the underground at this period in social history be conscious make a journey towards a new spiritual growth ; and this , as furlong ( 1973 : 106 ) suggest ,
the conversation angus cameron look incredulous , permanent . he friend james menzy the wine merchant , in who house he lodge , have say once , infuriate after a two - hour	argument	, angus do you believe nothing completely after think about it , cameron reply , james , i be tell a good thing once , by the sawyer at bunarkaig . i use to help there as a boy .
mrs menzy have die five year before , kill by malaria and stomach trouble from they time in bengal . menzy he have a yellow face with a stained - look flush on each cheekbone , and when he feel a bout of fever come on , he drink to drow the symptoms . now he look over at cameron , take stock of the quizzical lift of he right eyebrow when he look out below he black fringe , the down - turn of he mouth under he long curve nose , and begin to recapitulate he	argument	with care , uncomfortable aware that angus might think he be try not to sound drunk . consid , angus , he say . they have seize the session book at auchtergaven , and kirkmichael , and logierait , and and many another place .
he expect a few dozen people . but the rank and cluster of they stretch uncountable into the darkness . he turn to jame in amazement and see that he be enjoy he surprise , as though it confirm one of he	argument	. keen waft of pine resin sharpen the air . torch be bubbl out flame and stream smoke .
he let he word trail off . they all go over to the fire for plate of meat and bread . in he mind cameron continue the	argument	throughout the meal . he find in byer a brace scepticism like he own . yet speculation be actual fruitless now .

i have to adopt the aspect of receptivity . i be very receptive to the bible , authority . i be not interest in	argument	, philosophy i take the simple biblical past have no father i try to capitalise ( on he absence ) , resolve the oedipal struggle , ( create ) good feeling .
since this state of affair be of the essence of human perceptual consciousness and , therefore , of the human mind , it must follow that there be non - physical state of affair essential to the human mind . so a materialist theory of the mind be false . the much primitive physicalist response to this	argument	be to deny the claim that there be anything about the mind that bs do not know . all that bs lack be an ability to respond directly to stimuli of certain sort : v know no much than bs , he can simply do something bs cannot . bs be like a man who know all about swimm , even to the point of be able to train the olympic team , but who cannot swim he , and v be the man with the normal talent for swimm .
but this bring we back to the initial problem , which be precisely to explain how materialism could accommodate such a feel . we cannot , therefore , leave it as an irreducible fact about different physical process that they feel different . in fact , the mode of access	argument	be ambiguous . it might be interpret as say that v have a mode of access to he own brain different from any mode of access to v 's brain available to bs ; or that v have a different mode of access to the external world , and that this constitute the difference between he and bs . it be impossible to deny that v have a different mode of access to the external world from bs , for v can see and bs cannot .
it would make no sense to say that the dot in the picture have a gestalt of they , but to apply this model to the brain and experience would be just like that ; for , if the experience just be a state of the brain , then there be no way in which the character of the experience can be explain as the result of some perspective on the brain . nor , very abstracted , could it be the result of a perspective on the informational content of the brain ; for , in either case , the perspective would have to be the occurrence of some further brain or informational state and to both of this the scientist have complete access , and the problem reoccur . if what i say above be correct , failure of the mode of access	argument	force the materialist to deny that bs lack any knowledge and to adopt a behaviourist theory . when a behaviourist approach be employ , it be not apply only to perception , but to all cognitive state . remember that philosopher of the seventeen and eighteen century have already assimilate think to perception , this be not surprise .
first , an objector might try to press the fashionable distaste for the first - person perspective and say that the fact that i cannot apply the theory to i show nothing except that one should not approach the philosophy of mind via the first person . a philosophical theory be essentially a reflection on a practice , and the first - person perspective express engagement in the practice : to apply the theory first - personal be to confuse level . this be a spurious	argument	. a philosophical account give the necessary and sufficient condition ( at little in outline form ) for the application of a concept , and it should , therefore , apply in principle to anything that be a case of that concept . if it really be the case that all i be do when i have beliefs about the world be to have disposition to behave , then it ought to make sense for i to think of i believe in that term .
in show that cognition as a whole cannot be treat behaviouristically , i have not thereby show that a behaviouristic treatment of sense - experience be false . so perhaps i overkill miss the target : perhaps the behaviourist analysis of perception be sound , even though a general behaviourism be not , and what bs lack be not knowledge of the nature of certain mental state , but only the ability to respond spontaneous to visual stimuli , that be , to respond as a result of actual see they . reflection on the nature of the	argument	refute the behaviourist treatment of perception in particular . that argument show that knowledge of the external world cannot be reduce to behavioural disposition , for the very idea of a disposition function only in the context of an unreduced grasp on the physical world . but there be nowhere else that we might get we conception of the physical world from , other than perception .
there be , though , a host of reason for resist any kind of equation between mental representation and mental picture ; and all of this derive from one fundamental reason . any mental picture will require interpretation , and this interpretation will be another mental operation , which , on the view that think be have mental picture , will be another picture , which it will require interpretation , and so on and so on . this may look like an easy knock - down	argument	against a silly theory which nobody have ever serious hold : but what be true of mental picture would seem to be true of any kind of mental represent process which encode sensation in some determinate form . in other word , the argument work equally against the view that we think in a kind of mental language , that mental sentence rather than mental picture be the stuff of think . sentence and word also require interpretation indeed they would seem to require this very obviously than picture and so we be back on the circle of infinite regress .
well how do i know that this computer do not have a theory of the external world i have no argument , an objector would say , just a prejudice . well , i think that there be an	argument	of sort for say that a computer of the kind descri do not have a theory of the external world , do not have mental state which refer , and do not therefore have thought in any significant sense . there be representation in a language but no knowledge , and therefore no think in the human sense . we should attend to the fact that knowledge of the external world means represent a lot of fact at once , so many fact that we lose hold of the idea of representation .
but this be a fairly repugnant conclusion to many of we . do we really want to say that all we ever learn we know before even if we be say this in some technical computational sense how about a much modest version of the	argument	which say that only certain primitive concept be innate ( about three - dimensionality , causal relation , etcetera ) , and that the much sophisticate concept develop out of this through the time - honour process of differentiat fi concept from global one and integrat the result into complex , structure concept . this be not much help because ( a ) late - develop concept must still on the representational theory of the mind be present in this primitive concept ( there be no mere potential competence such as i potential but non - exist competence to know portuguis ) ; and ( b ) how and where do we draw the line between the primitive concept and the developed one predictable , perhaps , i regard this argument not as a demonstration that the acquisition of new concept be impossible , but as another reductio ad absurdum of the representational theory of the mind .
constructivism and development the constructivist theory of mind regard think on an analogy with action ; just as the representation theory take an analogy with draw and write . moreover , to the same extent that the representational theory be non - developmental ( recall the fodor 's	argument	against learn ) , the constructivist theory be developmental . i would not say that the developmental view be a consequence of the thoughtaction analogy exactly , because there could be constructivist theory that do not mention development . it be certain , though , that the constructivism that have receive the many attention in psychology and philosophy have be the developmental theory of jean piaget .
so why not say , then , that in development perception teach action , that as the information deliver up by the input system become progressive richer the infant become good able to direct he own movement , rather than say that cognisance develop out of action i answer to this point will be very philosophical than empirical . it will rely upon an	argument	from kant . in the critique of pure reason , kant 's aim be to show how objective experience be possible , to set out the conditions necessary for this ; whilst piaget 's aim be to show , give certain kantian assumption , how objective experience actual develop . one of the conditions for ascri to one experience of a mind - independent reality , kant argue , be that we should be capable of distinguish between that sequence of perception ( if you like , representation deliver up by the input system ) which be determine by the movement of object and that which be determine by we own movement .
autism be a very profound cognitive deficit indeed , and everythe that i have say up to now entail that a person who think significantly lacks an holistic character , and lack the relate quality of directedness , inhibition and co - ordination , will be profoundly affect . coda we have cover a lot of ground , and maybe the path through the undergrowth of	argument	and data be not a very straight or a very clear one . i certainly would not want to attempt a summary of the route we have take all the way from the mind - body problem to child try to win chocolate ; but i do need to make some conclud comment to justify the bold claim in the first paragraph that constructivism make the mind - body problem less intractable . i argue that the representational theory of mind , with it assumption that think be the possession of determinate mental state which be in some sense encoding ( pictorial , syntactic ) of actual or possible state of affair , contribute to the difficulty of the mind - body problem .
i how might such state be both mental and physical at the same time we do not want to say that one kind of state caus the other kind , but neither do it make much sense to say that they be parallel or identical . there be	argument	for all possible position , but none of they convince we for long ( see chapter 1 and 5 ) . _ that constructivism refer only to mental representation at the level of the input system , as entity which can be translate , very or less directly , into the language of neuropsychology . ( it refuse to take serious the claim that central - system process - think be explicable in terms of the causal interplay of representation . )
much , perhaps all , functionalist be thorough - go materialist who believe that mental phenomena be genuine physical phenomena see at a particular level of abstraction . this commitment to materialism mean that a couple of standard dualist objection must be face . first , there be the dualist 's	argument	that mental process cannot be physical process because physical entity such as neuron - lack certain quality such as intentionality or consciousness that characterize the mental . the response to this be that intentionality and consciousness be emergent property of physical system . neuron do not individually have the property of consciousness , consciousness emerge when a large number of neuron be interact in the right kind of way ; just as speed be a property not of any single component of a car , but an emergent property of the whole system when it be operat in an appropriate way .
furthermore , the work of young and he colleague , which i shall be discuss late in the chapter , show that be aware of the operation of , say , one be face processe system have vitally important functional consequence . however , the functionalist view be that it would be quite misguide to attempt to explain behaviou by make direct reference to the subjective or phenomenal quality ( technically know as qualia ) of this mental state . if it be really necessary to think of mental state as have qualitative content ( and see dennett , 1988 , for some powerful	argument	that it be not ) , then it follow from functionalism that such qualium do not have causal interaction with other mental state or behaviour and be mere epiphenomena . successful science the sceptic might , at this point , complain that while i may have sketch out the functionalist position , i have not provide any convince argument as to why one should believe it .
if it be really necessary to think of mental state as have qualitative content ( and see dennett , 1988 , for some powerful arguments that it be not ) , then it follow from functionalism that such qualium do not have causal interaction with other mental state or behaviour and be mere epiphenomena . successful science the sceptic might , at this point , complain that while i may have sketch out the functionalist position , i have not provide any convince	argument	as to why one should believe it . what i now want to suggest be that there be a lot of very successful science currently be conduct which literal depend on functionalism be true . if functionalism be false , then the success of the cognitive science be a massive scientific fluke .
this be the myth that i want to examine here . although the majority of scientist tend to be a little coy about metaphysical matter in they professional publication , they be often less so outside when write elsewhere , be prone to describe the framework of presupposition about perception within which they conduct they investigation as if it be a discovery in it own right and that discovery an explanation of perception . and although the majority of materialist philosopher base they belief in the neurophysiological theory of perception on	argument	rather than observation , they be , nevertheless , greatly influence by the apparent success of neurophysiology . the materialist theory of perception we may think of consciousness as have two component : sensation and perception on the one hand and willing or agency on the other ; or input and output .
moreover , rather as substance dualism tend to do , it seem to undermine the causal role of consciousness in , for example , bring about or influence action . for the causal relation of events would be just the same irrespective of whether or not the causal chain temporarily took on a mental aspect ( as in property dualism ) or ( as in substance dualism ) go mental for a while . a far tell	argument	against the dual aspect theory - and one that have be rare notice be that aspect be relative to viewpoint ; in other word , they emerge posterior to perception . they cannot , therefore , be invok to explain perception , even less the manner in which perception be relate to matter . much scientist implicitly , and the many philosopher explicitly , prefer identity theories .
the monotony of the individual neurone be irrelevant ; what matter be the infinite variety of they combination , of they pattern , which will become evident when we look at the nervous system at the right level . i shall deal with the language of neurophysiological description shortly . however , it be necessary to say a word or two here to refute this seemingly compell	argument	. we be so use to hear talk about the nervous system encod the outside world that it be easy to forget that this be a metaphor and it be one that have no place in serious philosophical discussion of the mind - body problem or the philosophy of perception . the reason the cod metaphor have such currency in contemporary talk about perception be that it seem to suggest a way in which very simple and apparently homogenous element such as nerve impulse can generate the richness and variety of consciousness .

have realise , i suspect , at little for the time be , that they be not go to get anywhere in they fight for equal prize money at wimbledon or the french , the women 's tennis association have come up with another proposal which i know have support in some area but which i certainly hope will also bite the dust . what they want in future be 32 seed in all the grand slam tournament instead of the 16 they have at present . they	argument	be that it be good for the tournament , a s well as the player concern , if as many as possible of the high rank competitor survive the early round . they also claim that the player have earn this protection by the performance in the rest of the year which have bring about they ranking . in i view , to have 32 seed , even in the man 's single where there be far great depth of talent than among the woman , cannot possible be justify .
jim coate executive director the british school lta the conflict within british tennis as wimbledon again approach , the	argument	about why british tennis be so poor still rage on , and be get even very heate . the june issue of tennis world be no exception , with letter and article give both side of the picture be publish ; the only problem be that , in they own way , they be probably both right . the lta be spend much and much money and whilst the rest of the world get stronger , we player get low in the ranking .

but 20 per cent of it hops be now in the form of oil and essence and it be a grow sector . it may well be there be nothing wrong with hops in this form except that i find that brewer who use they , such as whitbread and charle wells , produce beer with a bitterness that be a shade too harsh for i like . and david gardner 's defence of process hops do remind the listener powerfully of the	argument	advance by the brewer in the 1960 when they be replace cask ale with keg beer . in the 1950 and 60 there be superb beer if you catch they on the right day . but they could be vinegar the next day , he say .
we learn that clim be about tenuous niche in the horizontal rather than scal a sheer cliff , as the journalis have it . it be about oas of control where there should be none . it should come as no surprise then , that some of that who see bolt as fundamentally reduce the experience i have outlin above , and which be we common heritage , should cast around for some solid	argument	to counter it spread . hence the great cry have go up : leave the environment alone ! what be a few bolt beside the environmental devastation cause by a large quarry
this regular outburst have inevitable have an effect beyond that intended . if you start write to councillor and start complain that site of special scientific interest be be damage then broad interest be go to become involve . controversy and	argument	attract notoriety . in the spring a story appear in the observer under the headline power - drill rock climber accuse of vandalism , of how a minority be threaten the relationship between landowner and climber as a whole . the strapline above the story include the phrase mountaineer 's image on slide .
recreational damage be cit by the cpre as be short - term and minimal . chunks of the peak district be be gobble up and we be worry about the environmental implication of drill a few tiny hole . and as for damage to an historic monument , to wit dumbarton rock , and the subject of the piece in the observer , the photograph that appear alongside it give the lie to this self - generate	argument	. the climber be centre - frame , he offende bolt invisible , but in one corner and easily legible be a mess of graffiti ! think about this scenario for a moment .
much climber , french or whatever , be very happy to swop information and generally be helpful . also , many name be paint on the bottom of the route ecologically unsound , but convenient ! let the	argument	rage about the ethics of bolte . this crag be already equip , and there be nothing you can do about it except enjoy the security . when in rome etc .
this be mix . i be sad and angry that he should want to place a bolt and go so radical against the grain ; sympathetic with dave 's strong conviction ; peeve that i own route centrefold have be usurp . while acknowledge he	argument	for the bolt placement , i advise that he have do the route ; if other think a bolt should be place , let someone else go ahead and place it . shortly afterwards dave place a protection bolt in the roof just above the peg . the blatant placing of a bolt in a lakeland mountain crag produce considerable reaction throughout the rock clim fraternity .
and despite the rambler 's association suggestion of management etc , we have not make too good a job of protect other wilderness area open to the public . secondly , it appear that the military do not use range west much . this statement can defend both side of the	argument	. 1 ) therefore , why can not the public have access .
rachel brockelsby hull you dog be respond beautifully to the do and be reward train technique just as he should . as for the other matter , it sound like you dog could have earn he scab by either defend he , or have an	argument	with a cat . get a vet to check he over to be sure . either way , the problem you describe , combin with the fact that this be you first dog , make i think you should go back to the rspca and ask they to put you in touch with the much suitable , local training club .
here you be talk and hold forth , say the latter , but tell i this : be you go to kill the old woman you translators have would you kill here , but dostoevsky use the future tense for the officer , whereas the student 's i would kill be genuinely in the conditional . this distinction should be preserve ( even though the russian verb be not quite square with the english ) , since it belong to the novel 's overall life - against - logic	argument	: in theory the student would kill she , but in fact he will not . of course not ! he tell the army officer , and that be the end of it . act by theory , raskolnikov do kill she , and life impinge .
and yet he take no step to reintroduce it in late editions . i believe he come to see it would not do . as with the censore christian	argument	in notes from underground , i believe an unfathomable good luck wear the face of bad luck be on he side at the start . if raskolnikov be to have mount an assault of something like grand inquisitor proportion , if he be to have expatiate on the whole god business not be worth the pain of one misused child , then the time be not ripe ; we must wait for ivan karamazov . and if sonya be to have reply to he , what could she have say

the whole system be ill - conceive from the outset . that some very large companies should have lose a great deal of money on they little experiment show only how unwise they decision to pursue the technology be . look at the	argument	. since call must be make close to a node , then why not simply find a telephone kiosk must work this day and the cost will only be at the standard rate . then there be the absurd lack of ability to receive call .
in some situation postscript can be faster than the escape sequence type of printer control file . it use post fix notation , where	argument	come first and operators follow . this be basically the same as reverse polish notation as use on certain calculator , and follow directly from the stack base approach .
it be a collection of essay design to introduce la nouvelle critique to ignoran english reader : apart from the editor , the contributor include julia kristeva and philippe soller , and there be an interview with roland barthes . a polemical note be sound in the unsigned preface . it acknowledge that the follow text and they	argument	be difficult , but the difficulty be not to be hide we we have no right to hide it . nor , however , be it to be submit to the terrorism or plain language , that mythical weapon or that who prefer the comfort repetition or the ideological caress ; who do not want to read .
it be , however , write in a crusad spirit , without any critical distance , and it be inform , like belsey 's book , by the assumption that language or literature can give we no certain knowledge of the world . hawkes 's polemical purpose become very and very apparent as the book develops : it be to undermine , not only establish literary study , but liberal humanism it . he	argument	be fast - move but inexact , and he engage in some wild flourish of hegelian grammar : write , in short , do not reproduce ' a reality beyond it , nor do it reduce ' that reality . in it new freedom , it can be see to cause a new reality to come into be ( hawkes 's italic ) . or consider the density of trope and implication in the follow : new new criticism would thus claim to respond to literature 's essential nature in which signifier be prise utterly free of signified , aim , in it no - hold - barr encounter with the text , for a coherence and validity of response , not objectivity and truth ( hawkes 's italic ) .
as i have remark , culler 's structuralist poetics encoura some reader to think in terms of rapprochement between the new and the new criticism . anthony easthope 's poetry as discourse offer a complex blend of old and new . he take poststructuralist assumption about the death of the author and the disappearance of the self - subsistent ego , and apply they to the history of english poetry , in a work which combine ingenious close read , impressive knowledge of metre , and an overall	argument	of stratospheric thinness and remoteness . easthope believe that the modernist concept of impersonality , late systematize in the new criticism , and theorize by wimsatt and beardsley in they famous essay the intentional fallacy , be on the right line , but do not go far enough , as the author be not really banished . some of easthope 's approach recall that of c . s . lewe in the personal heresy .
the breakdown of english intellectual insularity be welcome in principle , but a few thing need to be say about this new turn to france . it have become common form to invoke the magic name of the french theorist , as if the name alone would cause a torpid academic establishment to collapse . the use of name rather than	argument	as ammunition have become noticeable in such exercise , on both side of the atlantic , as chris baldick remark in a review of frederick crew 's skeptical engagement : one lamentable practice which crew rightly scorn be the increasingly revive trick or medieval rhetoric in which one attempt to substantiate one 's theoretical argument not by anything so vulgarly empirical as a fact or a text but mere by invok a name from the sacred pantheon . derrida , foucault , kristeva , lacan , barthes : just reel off they name be ( as auden say in a very different context ) ever so comfy , since it safely defer the issue at hand to nothing less than a transcendent signify : in short , to a star .
it have become common form to invoke the magic name of the french theorist , as if the name alone would cause a torpid academic establishment to collapse . the use of name rather than arguments as ammunition have become noticeable in such exercise , on both side of the atlantic , as chris baldick remark in a review of frederick crew 's skeptical engagement : one lamentable practice which crew rightly scorn be the increasingly revive trick or medieval rhetoric in which one attempt to substantiate one be theoretical	argument	not by anything so vulgarly empirical as a fact or a text but mere by invok a name from the sacred pantheon . derrida , foucault , kristeva , lacan , barthes : just reel off they name be ( as auden say in a very different context ) ever so comfy , since it safely defer the issue at hand to nothing less than a transcendent signify : in short , to a star . this cling to authority have , in i experience , become noticeable in graduate student and young academics in the past ten year or so .
interestingly , anthony easthope acknowledge the distinction at one point in poetry as discourse : failure to distinguish clearly between signify and referent , the object it may refer to , have lead to serious confusion in some accounts of the ideogram . yet it be a confusion he frequently fall into elsewhere , as do other new accent writer . talle be case be convince , though he have certainly not say the last word on the matter , and there may well be far	argument	from that who be professionally engage in linguistic . there be interesting support material in a book by the american critic robert scholes , textual power , publish in 1985 and not consult by tallis . in tallis 's reading , saussure do not move from the sign , which comprise signify + signify , to reference , because he be not interested in do so , be concern only with the internal aspect of a language - system .
he do not intend to exclude reality . the error lie with saussure 's expositor . schole , however , believe that saussure be he inconsistent , and responsible for late confusion , but the thrust of he	argument	be very close to tallis 's , and both of they be concern as be thurley and nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language be a system of pure difference , without relation to reality . scholes provide a useful table , divide into three column , show how linguist and philosopher have agreed in make a tripartite division between signifier , signify , and reference , though they present it in a variety of terminology . for frege , it be expression , sense , reference ( ausdruck , sinn , bedeuting ) .
some of this write be acute and interesting , the product of lively mind with genuine insight into the state of contemporary culture . i would often rather read it than very conventional form of literary scholarship . yet it be frequently open to pragmatic self - refutation : it argue against reason by the process of reason , and a political cause , however radical , cannot be advance without the traditional process of	argument	and attend to evidence . there be admitted the playfulness of some version of deconstructionist rhetoric , which read like prose - poetry . but such text be subject to the limitation of purely aesthetic discourse , with no through road to action , and must become politically suspect .
sinfield believe that they be often irredeemable taint by ideology , at good to be read only in historical term , or subject to symptomatic reading , seek the fracture and fissure in the mystify surface of the text that show the true ideological condition in which it be produce . against this , ryan advance the humanistic belief that the major canonical text be not inherently reactionary , and that they contain implicit image and model of human freedom which transcend they immediate historical context and which late reader can respond to . this be an interesting eclectic	argument	which recall gadamer on the fusion of horizon ( the reader 's and the text 's ) , marcuse on the utopian possibility of high culture , and sartre on the necessarily progressive implication of major literature . ryan represent a kind of marxism that non - marxist might do business with , in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it . this be not alway the case .
it be never very apparent what freudian claims be base on , though they be widely accept in we culture . i scepticism have be reinforce by the recent work of frederick crew , who for many year be a lead psychoanalytic critic in america . during the 1970 he begin to lose faith in the whole freudian programme , and in he recent book , skeptical engagement , he provide detail and substantially support	argument	for abandon it . freud be not , however , like to be general reject , since he be so much part of the valued cultural furniture of the west . furthermore , attacks such as crew 's be , as he acknowledge , not take serious and reply to in they own term , but treat as symptoms of repress disturbance .
nevertheless , raymond talle , who own training be in medicine , have show to what extend one of lacan 's key concept , the importance of the mirror stage in the development of the infant 's sense of self , have no base in clinical experience . as far as talle be concern , lacan be a charlatan , the l . ron hubbard of psychoanalysis . yet he system , like other on the contemporary scene , be constructe so as to repel	argument	or contrary evidence . bowie , who admiration be tinge with honest caution , have sum up the lacanian system in this word : just as you can gain access to the cave of the unconscious only by be inside already , he seem to be say , so you can gradually reach towards an understand of i work only by understand it in advance .
much of the work that be rediscover may have the literary quality that will satisfy reader without particular feminist interest : the poem by woman that roger lonsdale include in the new oxford book of eighteen - century verse be a small - scale , easy accessible instance . nevertheless , in a feminist academic context write may well be study , not primarily for it literary but for it cultural inter . this question provoke	argument	in america about the norton anthology of literature by women , some of the content of which be say to have have little value as literature . a common feminist response be to say that the whole idea of literary standard , even standard as such , be a form of male domination . i refer to this significant dispute in pass , without engage in it , except to say that feminist be divide on whether they want to establish a countercanon or extend the exist one .
this phrase , and other like they , have be debate and ponder , interpret and reinterpret , as though they be the formulation of the great philosopher of the past , like plato or kant , rather than the work of a live thinker in mid - career . there be a sense in which interpretation without conclusion be a mode of play ; deconstruction insist that philosophical text must be read as though they be literary text , with full attention to they ambiguity and irresolution . in this light ,	argument	about the interpretation of , say , eliot 's poetry . indeed , it be a central assumption of deconstruction that the distinction between literature and philosophy be exaggerat , or arbitrary , or even meaningless . certainly , some of derrida 's late work , such as the post card , look very like experimental literature than philosophy in the normal sense .
anyone who can say so clearly just what derrida be say , or do , immediately put the reader in he debt . yet the clarity and rigour may in they be problematical . this be the position argue some year ago by practitioner of la nouvelle critique , who believe that clarity in	argument	be a form of ideological mystification , reinforce the status quo . put in such extreme terms , the position be clearly absurd and self - defeat . but , for derrida , who fusion or ( con ) fusion of obscurity and playfulness be an essential element in he textuality , norris 's exposition may represent a process of intellectual tidy up which leave out something important .
in america fashion can actual be enforce . a few year ago , as part of an annual round - up of critical book for encounter , i review an interesting speculative work on modern fiction by an american academic . i feeling about the book be positive rather than the reverse , but i complain in i review that it be stud with reference to fashionable french gurus that be purely cosmetic , add nothing to the author 's	argument	. a year or so late i chanc to meet he and he acknowledge that this be just criticism , but that he have be oblige to insert this name so that he book would look like a truly up - to - date , intouch work of scholarship . in 1982 at stanford i hear similar accounts of academic publisher require appropriate name and reference in book .
marxist invoke history as a transcendent signify , the ultimate in term of which everything else be to be explain ; but there be many history , not one , and we choose that which suit we . as edward pechter put it , history do not tell we what the text be , because we decide what history be , and then put history into the text , rather than the other way round . something similar be true of politics , another transcendent signify and	argument	- stopper . since politics be traditionally one of the major defin activitie of a rational humanity , the discussion of literature in political term be not only possible but desirable , as the major critics of the past have show . but the word politics it need to be deconstruct , since politics be to do with we ideal of what human life should be , about which there have never be agreement ; indeed , it be out of the disagreement that politics arise .
he believe that literary study have a cultural and humane rather than an intellectual value ; and the implication of he recent work be that there be other way of attain cultural value . this have some affinity with the marxist position . in a published	argument	between scholes and hirsch , the former make the follow statement , on the assumption that the conservative hirsch would disagree with it : at the heart i belief be the conviction that no text be so trivial as to be outside the bound of humanistic study . the mean graffito , if fully understand , can be a treasure of human expressiveness
scholes be not a marxist , but he american cultural populism have affinity with recent marxist write ; at the same time , hirsch and scholes find they in unexpected agreement . one might reach out to other affinity . when scholes write that no text be so trivial as to be outside the bound of humanistic study , i be remind of c . s lewis 's	argument	that any piece of write have a claim to be literary if someone can read it in a literary i.e . an absorb , attentive , love fashion . the effect of all this approach be to remove literature , as conventionally define , canonize , institutionalize , and teach , from the exclusive and isolated position which it have long occupy in the anglophone academy . even the mode proposal that literature should be read in it cultural context have large implication .
literariness be to be find as a basic principle in the work of the russian formalist and the new critic , and , elaborate formulate , in frye 's anatomy of criticism . it inevitable present it in formalistic term , and sometimes in overtly aesthetic one . the latter presentation be not so common , because of the general unfavourable associations of aesthetic in we culture , though it be imply whenever student be ask to approach a poem as a work of art , rather than as an historical document or a philosophical	argument	. indeed , a dilute croceanism underlie much of we critical and pedagogic discourse , with it reference to expression , feeling , intuition , and unique personal response . poem be very plausible refer to as work of art than novel ; the latter may have obviously aesthetic quality , but have many other thing in they as well .
something of the sort have already be introduce into some english degree , under the aegis of the verbal art association , who have make a welcome start with such work . the reading of english poetry would be accompany by a consideration of historical as well as current theory of poetry . this would include the	argument	of the major poet - critic of the past : sidney , jonson , dryden , johnson , and on to the romantics , victorian , and modernist . i cannot see how the canon of poetry could avoid be construct along historical line , though the problem and implication of canon - formation should be face , as part of theoretical study . it could take account of recent attempt to enlarge the canon , particularly by the addition of poetry by woman , and other marginalize group .
review and criticism be separate activity , but the good literary journalism can provide genuine and valuable criticism , as morris dickstein have point out . what be need be much journals that be prepare to publish long , serious , reflective essay or review - article , as the london review of book do . victoria glendinn , write as a biographer and literary journalist , have offer some judicious thought on the question , which summarize much of i	argument	: no one could doubt that the application of the academic mind to literature have be salutary in bringe rigour and discipline into criticism : clean text , scholarly annotation , precise analysis , intelligent even transform interpretation and reading ; and an intolerance for woolly emotional response , vague inflate recommendation , and subjective wallowings of all kind . but the academic mind , and the exigency of the academic career , have have the effect of split off academic approach to literature from the reading , in that word 's wide sense , of ordinary people
mr noel stock , who speak as one who have pound 's confidence in recent year and be in daily contact with he , explain that this passage derive from a hint throw out by jessie l . weston in she from ritual to romance , to the effect that the charge of heresy bring against the templar be not wholly unfound , since some of the practice of the eleusinian mystery - cult from the pagan near east survive in the heart of christendom in the ritual of the templar , a survival to be trace in literature in the storie and poem about the quest of the holy grail . from ritual to romance come out in 1920 , and be a new book when t.s . eliot borrow from it for the waste land , thus make it permanent famous ; pound could not have know of it in 1911 , but if he have then visit the templar 's cavern - church in aubeterre he could hardly have fail to remember it in the light of jessie weston 's	argument	. certainly in recent year pound be inter in mystery - cult have be much than antiquarian ; in be erigena we he ask whether the philosopher scotus erigena be one of the eleusinian brotherhood , and we can be give full weight noel stock go so far as to claim ( op . cit . p.22 ) that some of the obscurity of this late canto be deliberate and arcane he write about they as an initiate in word that be both publish and not publish . fascinate as this be , it be sure with relief that we return from thus check print source against print source , cross - refer and tentative identify , to the open air of the road of france .
the story be an intricate one , as herbert schneidau acknowledge ; and pound 's hold out against ford for the dantesque principle of a curial diction ( see he introduction to the poem of lionel johnson ) represent to i mind an objection that can still be raise to ford 's principle of diction , salutary as ford 's polemics undoubted be for pound at this time . moreover prothero , a historian , perhaps have no idea about poetic diction one way or the other ; pound , as we have see , think he victimize by prothero not for anything to do with wri but for have champion lewis the painter and gaudier the sculptor . all the same schneidau 's	argument	be just and illuminat , so far as it go . but do it go far enough it be worth look again at pound 's letter to michael robert , strident though it be .
if we resent this ( as we should ) , we ought to realize that it be we who be to blame for it . for neither kenner nor pound be a professional or obsessive anglophobe . both man be report what seem to they the fact of the case , and they be the much confident about do so because no englishman have arise to rebut they	argument	. for we to respond with sneer anti - americanism be the mere childishness . after this , pound 's relation with england and the english be for the much part an aspect of he relation with that one of he erstwhile protg who have become , surprisingly , a pillar of the english establishment eliot , editor of the criterion .
all he pride in he memory , he sense of the internationale of writer , painter , musician , and the aristocrat , he study of form as technique ( no contour , no edge , intellectual concept , but round , thrust , as a splash of color , as yeat descri he aim in the canto ) it be all a huge aestheticism , end in hate for jew , red , change , the content and matter often of disaster , a loss of future , and in that a fatality as death - full as that for who the atom bomb be armageddon , not apocalypse . again , pound 's admirer will protest ; and they will be right , insofar as yeat 's account of the canto be not so definitive as olson take it to be . but the main thrust of olson 's	argument	be unaffect , and it can not be set aside : this great american poet ( and olson know that pound be all of that ) be a fascist , profoundly , and no amount of talk about he affinity with whitman will save he for democracy , nor will any attempt to treat he anti - semitism as an unrelated pathological aberration . another escape hatch that olson slam shut upon we be the device of distinguish between pound - the - man and pound - the - poet . the trouble with this manoeuvre be that it cannot help but demote poetry .
an instance , and a momentous one , be tate 's review in poetry for november 1932 , of pound be how to read : the real criticism of mr pound be not to be directe against he theory as such , but rather at the hasty headlong fashion in which he present it , at the logical confusion of he intellect when it be not perform the task which be specifically he own , that task be poetry . the justification of mr pound 's thesis in how to read be not he	argument	, but he poetry . leavis , who counter how to read with a booklet , how to teach reading , and winters , who declare in 1937 , mr pound resemble a village loafer who see much and understand little , tell the same story as tate : pound be a naf , an imagination and sensory apparatus that consistently perform good than it know , in way that the maker 's own discursive intelligence fail to comprehend or measure up to ; in winter 's memorable and mordant judgement of 1943 , a sensibility without a mind , or with as little mind as be well possible . take pound the poet ( though in strictly limit dosage , if you listen to leavis or winter ) , and ignore pound the critic the message be loud and clear , and it be attend to .
the choreography likewise evoke change of weather and mood but without display any overt narrative development . the two central , baggy - suit dancer , lynne bristow and william trevitt , either mirror each other ' movement ( the old man perhaps commun with he diary ) or else dance as a couple ( the man relive past relationship ) . thus some slow , desiccate waltze and gentle lean have the quietude of an old couple on a dull mild day ; sequence of deft , steppy footwork and sharp edged leap have the high spirit of blustery sunshine , while a duet of rhythmic fidgety gesture have the feel of a lifelong	argument	continue during a rainy afternoon . the other four dancer regularly interrupt or echo this sequence with image from the past a robust trio , who folk step and causally thrown jump have the coltish energy of adolescence and two couple who look like lover court in the 1920 . by the end this quartet depart the stage in a halt dance of death and trevitt be roll up in a carpet , leave bristow alone without partner or diary .
britain 's kind of deficit arise not because the government need to borrow ; the public sector it be in heavy surplus . the deficit be create by the action of the private sector . if so he	argument	go consent adult in the private sector of different country lend money to each other , all that show be that capital market be usefully redirect the surplus saving of one economy to the investment opportunity in another . that detach observer , the international monetary fund , call this kind of deficit efficient and self - correct . history show it can go on for a long time , as deficit and surplus do during the golden age before the first world war .
history show it can go on for a long time , as deficit and surplus do during the golden age before the first world war . very recent history suggest the world have become much much like that again , with investment in each country break free from the constraint of domestic saving . evidence of excessive demand there be some observable good sense in this	argument	, and it help to explain why sterling have not hit the fan a lot earlier , during a truly spectacular sw from surplus to deficit over the past two year . but it limit be expose by ask a simple question : why , then , should mr lawson not be quite happy to see the deficit get even large why should a good deficit not get even good
today there be again a global capital market , but no gold standard , no fixe exchange rate , for britain not even a european monetary system . that be not mr lawson 's fault , of course , but he have to live with the danger that while the world 's capital market will duly bridge the gap between britain 's domestic saving and investment , they will only do so at a low price for sterl . if you take the	argument	about consent adult to it logical conclusion , that price britain 's exchange rate should be leave to they , too . but however suspicious mrs thatcher may be of manage exchange rate system , she dislike a falle pound as much as anyone . so we come back around the circle to the capital side of the balance of payment , and the operationally interesting question : for how long can we expect the world 's saver to make up we domestic shortage
it be , he argue , not at all clear how you raise private saving to close the other kind of gap . this point should not be push to perversity : the imf be still clear that a us - style deficit be bad , and it certainly be not be quickly correct . but mr lawson have to show he know how to do the trick , before he can win he	argument	, in theory or in the market . corporate profile : french flair and le mortgage push compagnie bancaire ahead : michael pr take a look at one of europe 's much unusual and successful financial group by michael prest
as the indian example show , domestic consumption be a vital factor . yet one must be cautious . historical teum have be a fair dull market , dominate by trade interest two	argument	against the london fox 's effort to excite inter in a tea futur contract . a balanced market , by definition , can sw surprise fast in the opposite direction : the chance be , for example , that malawi will not have a drotch next year . but for all i know , the ico could still be meet then .
rational judgement might have tell he that the nation 's plight be litthopele , but he be the vision of an avenge prophet . it be probable , storr observe , that england owe she survival in 1940 to this inner world of make - believe . what psychoanalysis call fantasie of infantile omnipotence thus come into play , together with other attribute of infantility greed , paranoium , and an inability to follow complex rational	argument	. churchill demand that all idea be submit to he on a half - sheet of paper ; he be frequently insensitive , a bad judge of character , and a sucker for flamboyant charlatan ; intensely loyal , he demande uncritical loyalty in return . the end of the war mean the end of the blissful congruence between fantasy and reality , and churchill turn to paint and write in an effort to regain that happy state .
the classic example of market failure be environmental protection . education and training and research and development be other area where government intervention be bad need . the dilapidation of we transport system and the shoddy state of we national service underline the	argument	for much public investment . labour 's change of policy on the european community put it in a strong position to argue that economic and industrial decision be increasingly likely to be make on a european basis and it be essential that britain play a much constructive role . we shall need to develop , for example , a viable policy on economic and monetary union .
but after 10 year of tory rule , he have have enough of that approach to politics . labou would be acquiesce in a democratic outrage if it continue argue that , because the conservative have get away with be undemocratic for so long , it be now labour 's turn . mr cook also countere the	argument	that pr would build in a pull towards the centre ground , prevent labour from implement a radical programme . it seem strange to make that argument , mr cook say , when it be clear the whole policy review process be design to placate the centre ground . i cannot honest see that a system which would require we to compromise the morning after the election be really so morally inferior to a system which have already oblige we to compromise we policy two year before polle day .
some recent work on green vervet monkey show that audience effect can be important in other context in which they functional significance be a little easier to identify . anne keddy hector , robert seyfarth and michael raleigh at the universitie of california and pennsylvania have be study parental behaviour among captive vervet to see if male 's parental ability affect the female 's choice of mate . they	argument	be that a male 's potential quality as a parent might be important because , in many specy of old world monkey , male form strong protective relationship with female and they young , which be crucial in reduce the amount of harassment and competition the young suffer from other member of the group . in a number of specy , bond between male and infant within a group may influence the chance of male mat with certain female . in baboon and japanis macaque mother resume they sexual cycle be very likely to mate with male who have form a relationship with they offspr .
that will be the guid light of the next labour government . when i insist on that priority , as i can tell you i much certainly will with the full support of the prime minister in do so then i be sure i colleague will see the point of that . now it be quite right of they , of course , to allow we social obligation not to be forget ; there will probably be an	argument	. there be in all government between the treasury and spend minister . but they will take into account the need for that balance that say that social spend without underpinn by economic growth will not be sustain in any event .
in the absence of the big idea , one good phrase would be a help , something to focus the uncertain and suggestible mood of the country and put it finger on what it be that be miss and want after 10 year of mrs thatcher . by the end of this week we shall know what the labour party no long stand for , such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and full - scale nationalisation ; but what , in essence , do it stand for if it do not exist , would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when , from the atlantic to the ural , socialism in all it manifestation be lose the	argument	to liberal capitalism for we should not become too carry away by labour 's change face and tone of voice , nor too dazzle by the peter mandelson image - conjur . the party may have put on a collar and tie but it be still the labour party , prone to it old reflex ( as it remind we yesterday on defence spend ) , prisoner still of it anachronistic structure , it mind set in 100 year of work - class history .
some anglican would certainly go far : the bishop of birmingham , the right rev mark santer , who be the anglican co - chairman of the theological commission try to overcome doctrinal difference between the two churche , say : if anglican and other non - roman catholic really do believe that the christian church be call to be at peace with it , how give the fact that christian be sinful do you actual keep the show together in the end , you do have to have some sort of juridical power if you be go to keep the institution together . this a very english and pragmatic	argument	for the necessity of a central authority in the church . it have be great influence by the tangled confusion into which the anglican communion have stumble over the ordination of woman . it start from the fact of disunity and ask which exist political mechanism can work well for unity .
environmental organisation , however , put the emphasis elsewhere . there be no incinerator which completely destroy toxic waste , madeleine cobbing , greenpeace 's toxics campaigner , tell i . the crux of we	argument	be that we do not need to have toxic waste and the fact that plant like rechem exist , provide easy option for company , be act as a disincentive for company to clean up . but another but what about the pcb that already exist although they be no long manufacture , they be still present , for example in electrical equipment .
although they be no long manufacture , they be still present , for example in electrical equipment . no one could therefore call for the closure of incineration plant at a stroke , because noxious chemical have to go somewhere . so a part of the	argument	switch to the kind of incinerator you allow while industry be force to clean it up . also , how this should function and perhaps much important of all where you put they . mr wheeler , now move to the rear of the plant to show off the 2m smoke - clean section , which have just break down , point out that he company achieve destruction of at little 99 .9999 per cent of all material .
if south africa or a south american country make a pitch for hong kong entrepreneur , number could rise sharply yet again . it be a matter of principle for the hong kong government that it should not seek to restrict the number leave , whether directly or by influence resettlement country . but , particularly since tiananmen , it have be echo the	argument	that people would be less concern to leave hong kong before 1997 if they could be absolutely confident that other country would accept they after that date . the governor , sir david wilson , have argue for a general right of entry to britain though such a right could not be of much value if it be not ordinary convertible into full citizenship . official also talk of an armageddon scenario , ask that britain secure international agreement to accommodate million of hong kong refugee in the event of tiananmen - style repression after 1997 .
already , president george bush be talk about a full restoration of sino - we relation . other nation , especially japan , wait impatiently in the wing with they offer of soft loan . to that who see china in primarily economic term , the golden goose	argument	come much easy : that it government would never be so foolish as to constrict or repress hong kong , the tiny territory which have prove such a powerful catalyst for the growth of it hinterland . in eight year , such optimist claim , china will be adjust to hong kong , rather than vice versa . great tract of the middle kingdom will be virtually indistinguishable from the tiny entrepreneurial enclave .
it be easy enough to say what makes martin run : a sincere belief that hong kong need true democracy , even if many of it present leader disagree . the much difficult question be how long he can continue as a one - man movement . he have be one of the legislative council 's much diligent member , a demand enough job ; he accept china 's offer of a seat on the basic law drafting committee , help to write hong kong 's post - 1997 mini - constitution , and be embroil in very unsuccessful	argument	for direct election , oppose by mainland communist and hong kong conservative . he have be an energetic supporter of the democracy movement in china ; and of hong kong campaign to secure right of abode in britain . not surprise , from time to time , he fatigue show : the voice crack , the temper fray , the judgement falter .
as senna race towards the victory he need in spain on sunday , james hunt , a driver familiar with the pressure of a late challenge for the championship , be say senna have no right to be on the track at all . or , at little , not if you compare senna 's comparatively lenient fine for ignore a warn flag last friday with the harsh justice deliver to nigel mansell earlier in the week . the	argument	be that senna 's crime as he rush past the scene of an accident be infinitely very dangerous than mansell 's failure to stop on the command of a black flag . although guarantee the driver 's championship , mclaren be on a loser no matter what happen . if prost win , then he take the title with he to ferrari and , in exchange for the high desirable number 1 and 2 the italians will present 27 and 28 to mclaren , a particularly irksome detail for such a dominant team to accept .
that , in i opinion , be dead right . but the important quality about dick crossman , which make he unique among member of parliament and make he testament to the understand of british government unique , be that he be the pure , 100 per cent archetypal don , a don through and through , albeit a don who special subject be politics in practice . crossman tend to presume that all that he come across , at work or social , like nothing good than to have they intellectual sacred cow challenge , they	argument	question and they assumption subject to loud investigation . that be the portrait of a don , a don in he supreme incarnation , a don go about the business that he be design for by nature . of course , as should be the way with a don , he excite dismay - dismay much than dislike or distrust .
from lady jane howard sir : professor gomme ( letter , 3 october ) argue the case for the exact recreation of the interior of uppark much cogently ; and certainly , careful and committed reconstruction , such as can be see at chatelherault where hamilton district council have faithful , and against all the odd , achieve a marvellous reproduction of william adam 's hunt lodge for the fifth duke of hamilton , be not to be jeere at . but anna pavord 's recognition ( 27 september ) of the opportunity for the twenty century boldly to turn uppark 's tragedy to advantage , be a much compelling	argument	. why not create an exhibition centre inside a perfect restore exterior for exhibition of all that be good in furnishing in national trust ownership - a burrell within a claverton there could be exhibition of the good tapestry and textile , the fine portraiture , the much outstand silver ; or the good of a certain period draw together from national trust house ; and perhaps link display on craftmanship , technique , restoration and conservation .
why the need for such an ambitious plan now it be the last hoorah of the economic regulator , he say . they lose the government spend	argument	in the late seventy and eighty , now they be try the environmental route . on a good day the climate in la be close to perfection : it be possible to understand what bring all this million to a vast , waterless , resourceless basin , between the mountain , the desert and the sea . but dr lent say the blue skie and soft breeze be mislead .

there be two kind of violence good or bad . it be the difference between the person who knock you down to take you purse and the person who knock he down to come to you rescue . burrow believe that smack be as necessary as kisse and cuddl , and find it ironic that the same kind of	argument	about parent not know when to stop be use to underi we instinct in both case . she say : smack be a way of educat the aggressive instinct of child . aggression be not somethe child learn from they parent , they be bear with it .
for have be comfortable enough for many of the first half . they go ahead in the 30th minute when tommy gaynor skip away from a couple of tackle and let fly from 25 yard : no sign of gratitude there for eoin hand , huddersfield 's manage , who have help along he fellow - irishman 's career in the early day at limerick . hand 's team , however , reply impressive seven minute late when maskell , transfer - list at he own request after score 33 goal last season , score he first of this , cecere lay the ball off to the ambitious young man who crisp drive be a powerful	argument	for a rise in status . for regain the lead four minute into the second half when gary crosby , chase nigel clough 's clever pass , sweep past chris hutchings and pok the ball between steve hardwick 's leg . it seem all over in the 63rd minute when clough , a few yard outside the penalty area , volley a headed clearance instantly into the roof of the net before hardwick could move a muscle .
the slowdown in military spend and escalat cost of armament programme will make it increasingly difficult for any company , even one the size of bae , to go it alone . the recent improvement in east - west relation must also make the market for military equipment less favourable . but as professor smith he note , there be one important caveat to this	argument	. any increase concentration among defence supplier will depend crucially on the attitude of individual government . past experience suggest that some government , at little , may not be prepare to sit this one out .
in draw attention to many such embarrassment , davie 's book be sure to provoke a good deal of rancour in certain circle . yet it would not be quite right to call under briggflatt controversial , for that deaden word implies a self - serve wish to shock which be far from davie 's consider ang . and if davie 's principle make he what some might call elitist or undemocratic , as in he stinge verdict on catchpenny enterprise like the arvon poetry competition , it be not without he have ponder the	argument	about the place and function of elite and of high art in a democratic nation far very deep than the bulk of he fellow countryman . just as importantly , he be possess of a generosity of mind which allow he to be calm judicious about the merit of writer who can advocate militant homosexuality and drug - take ( such as thom gunn ) , sympathise with feminism ( elaine feinstein ) or adhere to some variant of marxism ( hugh macdiarmid ) . both in he sternness and in he generosity , davie be strongly reminiscent of a much early write , who name be invok towards the end of under briggflatt .
a simpl solution than electoral reform be to abandon the policy and attitude which have barr labour from power , which be what mr kinnock have be about . an unholy alliance with other minority to preserve ideological position otherwise unacceptable to the electorate do not appeal as a noble enterprise . refut the	argument	that proportional representation would mean trimm to minority centrist position , robin cooke , one of labour 's lead advocate of reform , say : we have already go to endless length to placate the centre ground . exactly . a properly function two - party system have a centrifugal dynamic .
the growth of third party in the seventy and early eighty be in a large part a product of the malfunctioning of the two - party system , partly as a consequence of mrs thatch 's rejection of the post - war consensus but chief as a result of labour 's leftward lurch . mr kinnock be correct to insist that fundamental change in the vot system should not be undertaken for short - term , tactical reason . nor be there much in the fairness	argument	, although this be the reason offer by 46 per cent of the people interest in pr . i cannot see that one vote systey be intrinsically very fair than another . it be not fair , perhaps , that with 23 per cent of the vote the alliance should have won only 3 per cent of the seat in the house of commons .

townshend be much famous for beat he guitar against speaker stacks , but it be also worth remember that , on stage at the ricky tick club , windsor , in may 1966 , he attempte the same stunt against the head of keith moon . for he part , moon manage to fry a sizeable portion of townshend 's hair by misjudge a flash powder explosion in he drum kit during the make of an american tv special . the on - stage	argument	and bust - ups practically become a feature of the show , with daltrey almost permanent poise to quit , but somehow hang on . and when they be not trash each other , they be trashe they . moon die in 1978 , after an overdose of the prescribe drug he be take to ease he out of alcoholism ; townshend have he own dark period of excess ; even entwistle , the quiet , static one , feel inclined to release a solo album entitle smash you head against the wall .
at the moment , they be not encourag . the consumer would appreciate some stability . perhaps much variety , too , although enthusiast 's assertion that not everyone be obsess by the big five be countere by east who , as a football nut and a director of derby until he move into he current post , know all the	argument	. we be not a public service , he say , and we will not attract viewer by go to half - empty stadium . they want to share in big - match atmosphere .
on the other hand , a pro - right clergyman suggest that it be we traditional despotic treatment of the non - human creation which have be truly infantile , and that it be only in this century that we have begin to grow up a little . the programme scrupulously refuse to attribute full maturity to either faction , dwell on the bestial act commit by animal right terrorist - the bristol university bomb and so on as well as on the vile surgical mutilation which have provoke they , and ian breach 's presentation script be both deft and literate ; a model guide through this complex issue . but the very process of put picture to the	argument	tend to weight the case in favour of the critter lobby . it be easy to sway the emotion by show monkey with they brains cut open , genetically stunt pig or smoke beagle , less so to drag on someone suffer from a vile disease and say this person will die unless we keep on chopp up small furry creature .

book review / thatcher be early day on the seat of power : margaret , daughter of beatrice leo abse : jonathan cape , 12.95 pound by auberon waugh in a long apologium for have have the temerity to undertake a psycho - biography of mrs thatcher , leo abse deny that he book be a personal attack on she , but agree that it may have some admonitory function in warn people not to acquiesce too readily in the disposition of someone who would appear , on he	argument	, to be grave unbalance . he justification for the necessary invasion of privacy be the familiar - and thorough respectable plea that politics should and must be personalise . politics have very little to do with issue ; it be all to do with the personal vanity and ambition of politician .
but this do not stop abse construct an elaborate these base on thatch 's sphincter morality , for which she mother , beatrice , should really take the blame : thatcher succeed in initiat the electorate into a new form of gambling : she personal need to end the early constraint which she have endure , outlaw the joy of shitt and coprophilium , drive she to open the door of the stock exchange , and end it exclusivity . this would seem a benign effect of thatch 's bad potty train , except that abse have a bee in he bonnet against gambling . the second real objection to this form of psycho - biography be that as soon as freud be quote as gospel , the whole	argument	descend into music hall burlesque for everybody but dedicate freudian . the aetiology of the urge to gamble lie in joyless masturbation and early , still - unresolve bisexuality , proclaim abse , after freud . much intelligent people who have not accept freudian indoctrination will ask he to tell that to the marine .
she affection for the bomb be explain by the fact that it be energy - charge and penis - shape . all of which be quite funny for a bit , but become bor because it be obviously such rubbish . what be particularly bor about it be that all the	argument	be circular . have observe thatcher 's boorish behaviour , abse comment : such a jealous and ruthless super - ego can only have be form by a prohibit mother who be brusque and prematurely insist upon early toilet train . from that possibility , he go on to blame bad potty - train for all she character defect .
as mr torode point out , we liberal forefather insist on the importance of tes faith by submitt they to discussion . liberal commitment to free speech must also be test in this way , lest it become an unthink orthodoxy a mere article of faith . to submit the free speech principle to such a test be not an	argument	for book - bann . it be a plea for consistency . if we demand that the faith of other be test , how can we refuse to test we own

during the debate roy hattersley , the deputy leader , argue that it would be historic folly for labour to back proportional representation ; inevitable coalition would mean that we would never again have a labour government that be able to carry out a labour programme . but advocate of pr say afterwards that the issue would not go away : labou have yet to decide it prefer method of elect it propose regional assembly and it replacement for the house of lords . jeff rooker , the mp for birmingham perry barr , who retire from labour 's front bench last year partly to campaign for pr , say : a lot much people go away from this conference convince of the merit of the	argument	than be show in the vote . gavin laird , the general secretary of the amalgamated engineer union , say that it be the last burning issue labou need to resolve before the next election . mr hattersley say during the debate that he and neil kinnock be very determined than ever to resist pressure for labour to back pr , because voter would suspect that the party lack confidence in it ability to win under the present system .
they claime that the director be the sole author of he film , and that the much strongly he personality and preoccupation be find in they , the greater he be . with the exception of hitchcock , who they worship , they have little time for accept and acclaimed director , find much value in the much commercial movie of , for instance , howard hawk and raoul walsh . with a vigour amount to tactlessness they put dissension and	argument	into film debate , too long overshadow by blind acceptance of yesteryear 's taste . it take as long again for they theory to be discredit , despite the fact that almost none of they hollywood idol would agree that they be the sole auteur of the film they make ; while the great weakness of they belief be that the much flawed work by one of they prefer film - smake be of very intere than a major piece by one of that they do not rate . year late one of cahier ' much influential critics , jean - luc godard , admitt that none of they have really believe in the theory , but have use it to draw attention to they .

many of it difficultie will not be solve either by john prescott 's idea for great rail and bus use , or by cecil parkinson 's new and wide motorway . the only answer be to spread the people and the job thinner so that few traveller , bring they car and they litter - journey into it or through it . this be not an	argument	that should only concern south - easterner . love it or hate it , the south - east do contain 30 per cent of the population of the unite kingdom . it be the engine that drive the economy .
but the declaration issue by the congress leave no doubt that the decision be intended to be much than a mere facelift : the present concept of socialism , the stalinist system , have exhaust all it social , economic , political and moral reserf , and have prove unsuitable for keep pace with global development . thus the history of the hswp as a state party have come to an end . to sidestep any	argument	about who should inherit the party 's vast fortune if a split occur , the delegate declare they to be the legal heir of the hswp , whilst dissociat they from the old party 's crime , false and mistaken principle and method . the found document state that member of the old party will not automatically receive they new card . they will all have to apply and sign the hsp 's statute and programme .

at the conservative party conference in 1986 , norman fowler , then secretary of state for health , produce a computer printout of 380 new large hospital scheme : the list be so long because he have count every programme over 1m , whereas scheme have previously have to cose over 5m in order to qualify . at present , a minister who abuse statistics in this way have only to fear the counter - assertion of the opposition , no less self - interested . one	argument	to which the government have no right to resort be that statistics do not matter . it be obvious that good economic indicator no very ensure good economic management than accurate instrument on the dashboard of a car ensure safe drive . but since minister , include the prime minister , be so fond of use statistics for the purpose of debate , they cannot be allow to make the contradictory claim that this figure be irrelevant .
economic difficultie be foreclose on mr lawson at an awkward moment for the government . the rumour which upset market yesterday of a renewed difference of opinion between the down street neighbour appear this time to be without substance . but exchange rate trouble draw attention to the unresolve	argument	between mrs thatcher and she chancellor ( backe by sir geoffrey howe ) about subject the pound to the formal discipline of the european monetary system . the bundesbank have make mock of mrs thatcher be when the time be right position . this arcane dispute contribute to the electorally damage impression that the prime minister be will to hammer the country on the anvil of she dogmatism .
now i be by nature an enthusiast . i have no idea whether europe be go to work , no one have , and i can think of huge historical reason why it will not . but i know this ; if it be go to work , there be no	argument	that denies britain a place at the lead edge of what be happen . obviously , by background and experience i be wholly commit to the benefit of the capitalist system . but i be a tory .
about a third of that interview say they have run away because of problem at home . a similar number run away after be place in local authority care . many spoke of be unable to get on with parent , often a step - parent , lead to constan	argument	or violence . ninety - eight ( 18 per cent ) say they have be sexually abuse at some time , include 82 girl the victim of rape , inc , sexual assault or prostitution . seventeen girl say they be sexually abuse by much than one person .
the important thing be that the thirty year rule be in force and that we can respond to develope perception of we time . early this year , in i capacity as chairman of the thirtie society , i ask caithness 's successor , virginia bottomley , to reconsider english heritage 's recommendation of bankside for list . i	argument	be that , as michael heseltine have so boldly list battersea power station in 1980 , it be illogical not to protect a much finer and very complete industrial work by the same architect . furthermore , the lis of battersea have ensur the building 's survival for conversion to a new use in that case , as an entertainment centre which the prime minister herself have praise and inaugurate . after two month 's silence , i be inform that minister stand by they decision .
accordingly , he have argue , it should be of concern only to that involve in the respective private sector transaction . if only the market and the medium would get over they obsession with the current account number then the government too could forget about they . this	argument	derive from an idea with a distinguished academic pedigree . the reasoning be simple . if a country have a current account deficit , then collective it be spend very on thing produce abroad than it be ear from abroad .
after all , in every other aspect of economic behaviour we now espouse a liberal philosophy . why not in this aspect also the main problem with this	argument	be the consequence of a current account deficit for the exchange rate . take britain 's case with a deficit run at about 20bn a year . this will mean 20bn - worth of sterling come on to the market to buy foreign currency .
if much of this information disappear after 1992 ( with the demise of customs barrier ) , the problem to which it relate will not . the suggestion that it will be like the idea that we can deal with inflation by cease to collect data on the price level . the chancellor should be wary of the	argument	that the deficit do not matter because it be in the private sector . give he concern with the exchange rate , the argument do not stand up to analyse . the truth of the matter be that the current account deficit be a touchstone for the success of the thatch revolution .
from john lichfield in washington the florida state legislature begin a special session yesterday devote entire to abortion law . early this week , the first television debate in a fascinating and closely - fight virginia gubernatorial race be dominate by the	argument	for a woman 's right to choose and a foetus 's right to life . when the supreme court decide in july to weake the nationwide constitutional right to abortion grant in 1973 , political pundit predict a flurry of abortion - restrict legislation and political blood - let at state level . they also predict abortion would overwhelm all other issue in a series of gubernatorial election this autumn and in the state legislative and we congressional election next year .
china increase it patrol along the border with hong kong yesterday in an apparent effort to prevent an exodus of it people into the colony follow a dispute over immigration procedure . the dispute be trigger by hong kong 's decision to allow the top chinese swimmer , yang yang , who have sotch political asylum in the west , to travel to the us last week . however , the dispute reflect very the grow mistrust between the two side rather than an	argument	over visa and number . hong kong official say negotiation with china to end the dispute be continue and that the colony 's border guard be in a state of high alert in preparation for a possible influx . police source say china have double it patrol on the border .
mr scrivener say : this court have no power to order repayment of ultra vire expenditure , and he comment on the presence of bank representative , say : i have difficulty with they be here . if the bank want to seek relief , they would have to do so through a separate case bring against the local authority , he add . although the banks will begin to present they	argument	today , mr scrivener say : this court be not concern with private right . there be no justiciable issue between the auditor and the bank . the two judge , lord justice woolf and mr justice french , widen the scope of the hear by rule that argument about the enforceability of the transaction could be present .
this follow a private hear before mr justice konrad schiemann in london . it be allege that the flock be infect with salmonella typhimurium . the judicial review hear will take place on friday in the high court when the full	argument	will be present , according to dennis cooper , who be represent the nun . in a write application for the review , lawyer say the decision to slaughter be make despite a significant lack of evidence of a connection between the food poison outbreak in bedworth and the monastery . ministry official be also accuse of give conflict evidence , leave doubt as to the accuracy and reliability of report of infection .
we would be force to invent much and much mechanism to avoid the realignment which member of the erm be bind to face . in the long - term , this may be very damage than a short - term run on the pound . predictable be the reference to we non - membership be the result of narrow - mind nationalism , and this emotive point somewhat detract from the overall objectivity of many who put forward cogent	argument	for british membership of the erm . in this context , although mr lawson support the erm , he too would be , no doubt , a narrow - mind nationalist when face with the prospect of european monetary union , as would increase number of german economist who argue on the basis of economic research that emu be not necessarily an attractive option . it be a tragic fact that the european debate , which be the much complex and important issue face the country of this continent , should be treat in such a facile manner , with the trojan horse of nationalism and sovereignty wheel out every time good argument do not prevail .

if this be allow to continue it mean the destruction of the british egg industry , according to unite kingdom egg producer ' association , which represent around 80 per cent of producer . the nun from the our lady of passion monastery at daventry be seek to block an order to slaughter one of they flock , which be alleged infect with salmonella typhimurium . the fundamental issue behind the	argument	that will be hear be that the nun be not permit to see the result of the ministry of agriculture test confirm the presence of infection . there be no right of appeal within the law . under the testing of poultry order 1989 , egg producer must test bird who be 18 week or old once every two month .
a nation , wrote burke , be a partnership between the past , the present and the future . so let there be no doubt . just as there be an overwhelm moral	argument	for prudent management of the environment . fill in much detail on the environment protection bill for the com session of parliament , mr patten say the public would be give much access than ever before to information about industrial pollution and about how individual firms would be oblige to clean up they operation . fines for litter lout will go up from a maximum of 400 to 1,000 .
face with a demand that could no long be meet , the moscow city father 10 day ago limit purchase to one item per person . but the queue continue symbolise a gather flight from money amy constant rumour that a currency reform be in the offing . this would be aim , the	argument	run , at confiscat the ill - get gain of speculator in the much - hate co - operative movement , and at eliminate a surplus currency overhang of up to 150bn rouble ( 150bn ) . as must any government in similar circumstance , moscow denies any such intention . i can say firmly and unambiguously no , ' declare leonid abalkin , the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reforms , when question on the subject by the government newspap izvestia .
yet the disappoint applicant have an unfetter right to extend the period of disruption by appeale . improvement in the handling of appeals the year have see two separate and different initiative . the first be announce in a practice direction ( 1989 ) 1 wlr 281 , which provide for the much early delivery of skeleton	argument	which would be study by the judge before they sit to hear the appeal . the primary purpose be to reduce the costly time spend on oral argument in so far as that be not necessary for the proper determination fo the appeal . it be too early to reach firm conclusion as to the direction 's effectiveness .
but the likelihood be that bad argument will dominate the discussion . on all known form , campaigner , opinion - former and politician they will engage in polarise rhetoric rather than genuine debate , particularly since amendment by pro - life campaigner will seek to yoke the issue of abortion to the question of embryo experimentation . what a beneficial change it would be if instead it be acknowledge that this issue present tragic choice between compell	argument	which be hold on both side in good faith . there be five bad line of approach which should be banish from the debate and from all discussion of law and moral . the first line of attack be often name - call : you would say that , would not you , because you be a catholic/a man/fertile/infertile/a doctor/a research scientist .
it be difficult enough for an individual to be consistent , let alone a society . be all pro - lifer anti - capital punishment , anti - nuclear weapon and anti - car suppose that we do turn away from the cheap	argument	, where could we find a good way sadly , the warnock majority be confuse as to it basic philosophical argument , condemn utilitarianism in it foreword but rely on it in justify it crucial recommendation to allow experiment up to 14 day , only to reject it again in oppose the routine test of drug on human embryo at any stage from conception . the government have wisely allow legislator to choose between this approach and one of the warnock minority alternative .

in what be herald as a vote of conscience , any conscience ought to be deep troubl by the agonise choice between respect human embryo from they earli moments and respond to the plight of infertile couple . the issue represent the ultimate test and perhaps the convergence of two oppose moral theory . recognition of that and an agreement to forego the linguistic trick and the cheap jibe would help convince all side that they	argument	have be listen to with respect . it would also help convince they that politician have decide not on the basis of the good orchestrate campaign but by seek to occupy the high moral ground , wherever it might be find . law : a bad system for tackl hacker : proposal to curb computer crime may have the opposite effect , argue mary fagan
nicholas ridley add to the general glee by say the government be in favour of legislation . but few believe the finding of the law commission , or government action , will prevent either hack or computer - relate crime . indeed , there be a strong	argument	that stretch the long arm of the law to the innocent hacker could escalate rather than curb serious crime . emma nicholson 's private member 's bill against hacker , which fail to make the grade in the last session of parliament , require anyone who enter a computer to he or anyone else 's advantage , or to another 's prejudice , to be charge with a serious offence , with a maximum penalty of 10 year . the law commission have be much much exact in specify intent to commit serious crime as a necessary ingredient for one of the two very serious offence it propose .

but this ignore the effect of new account rule set out in ssap 24 , which require company to spread a surplus over a number of year . drg have spread the surplus over 8.5 year , which be long enough to justify valu it as part of the overall earning stream . drg 's property asset have also give rise to	argument	. mr franklin say the promised stream of profit average 10m over the next five year have a present value of roughly 44m . he say he be prepare to be prove wrong suggest he would raise he offer if drg produce a high valuation .
i go into the bedroom where alison be lie down in what seem to be a state of shock . i be about to call a doctor and then , sudden , i have a feeling which i can only describe as excuse i ecstatic . i feel that the world and everything in it be benign , that alison be infinitely precious and that dummett 's	argument	from value that we know there be right and wrong to a transcendent be be certainly sound . i say all this to alison , and i have be say it to she ever since , and , back in london , i have be say it to anyone else who will listen . on wednesday i meet mrs matthew in the street and she ask if i will take the cat to the vet and i admit that i have not .
the blackpool meet be the first between mr savimbi and a british minister , underli the importance britain attach to persuade mr savimbi to return to the conference table . the unita leader indicate that he be ready to do so , and suggest a meet in libreville within the next month . mr savimbi be meet president mobutu sis seko of zaire in paris on monday , and yesterday the angolan foreign minister , pedro de castro van dunem , hurry there to put he side of the	argument	to the zairean mediator . official say it be because the two side have different version of what be decide at the previous negotiation that the ceasefire have break down . angola wants mr savimbi to go into voluntary exile while election be hold , perhaps to return late , but he supporter say there be no such agreement .
ferrari yesterday decide to drop it appeal against the 32 , 000 fine and ban impose on nigel mansell follow he failure to stop after be disqualify from the portuguese grand prix , write maurice hamilton . the portuguese authority have promise to hear ferrari 's appeal against the fine next wednesday , after which the fia , the international automobile federation , be due to reach a decision on ferrari 's appeal over mansell 's ban from the spanish grand prix which be stage on 1 october . ferrari , while still convince they	argument	against the sanction be valy , but mindful of the tradition they represent , say they wish to remove any disturb element from formula one race during the final two race of the season in japan and australia . apart from clear mansell 's name if they upheld the appeal , the fia tribunal would be of little far use to either the englishman or he team . the fia say last week that the result of the spanish grand prix would remain , regardless of the outcome of any appeal .
this be true irrespective of the level of violence , although the masculine occupational culture of the force contain many of the same sanitizing euphemism for violence against woman ( give the wife a diggin ' . in the one instance of domestic violence we encounter during field - work , the officer arrest the man against the protestation of the wife , as be often the case ( see field et al . 1988 ) , despite faragher 's	argument	, although primarily in we case because the man redirect he attack towards the police . there be also big crime call , which refer to the real job of crime - fight , which the section police enjoy much . during the period of field - work the sort of crime that occur in easton under this heading include murder and major robbery , possession of drug , break and enter , car chase for steal vehicle , and the occasional sex - relate crime .
1988 : 22737 ) . very recently this consensus have be attribute to similar pattern of socialization into the canteen culture of the police ( for example , brogden et al . 1987 ; reiner 1985 ; for an earlier and relate	argument	see van maanen 1973 , 1975 ) , and thus to the existence of a generalize police occupational culture . but it be not only typical pattern of informal on - the - job train which be important , for there be also a congruence in aspect of formal police train ( on both aspect of train see fielde 1984 , 1988a , b ) . the ubiquity of this notion also reflect that the labour process it influence policeman and woman in how they view they work , and the sociology of policing have show how routine police consist of similar tasks wherever it occur .
a third effect which could be add be that business experience would be gain by the local merchant , and thus the society begin to develop a pool of people with such business experience . experience of this nature may reduce the reliance of less develope country on good import from abroad ; local manufacturer may be able to satisfy local market need by intelligent market , and thus gain a large share of the local market than before , with consequent result for local level of production and the economy general . a further element in this	argument	be the possibility that advertise can be use as part of a market strategy to shape the wants and need of a less developed society in a direction that be clearly beneficial . for instance , if a country concern still employs traditional system which , in the light of much modern technique , appear to be detrimental to public health , it may be desirable to change pattern of behaviour in , say , nutrition or hygiene . often this will not be successful if the population be attach to it traditional method and the new method be radically different from the old ; a careful market campaign to change attitude can have a dramatic effect , particularly by present new product in a way that be not dramatically different from the old .
any diminution of freedom reduce the quality of life . there may be compensation for a loss of freedom but there be no substitute for it . on the other hand ,	argument	that freedo be valuable for something other than it be seldo convince . usually they be a mixture of wishful think and libertarian special pieading . as far as british news medium be concern , freedom simply do not perform the task that mill 's follower hope it would .
that approach , which give two - third of news coverage to the incumbent government , be reasonable , even generous , if view in the context of the mobilizing ideal which accord priority to establish authority . equally , it be unreasonable , even unacceptable , in the context of other ideal for the relationship between the medium and society . harrison and other defend the present system with another	argument	. they agree that the government get extra television coverage but argue that such coverage be not necessarily favourable . in 1987 perhaps the prime minister 's pre - election visit to moscow and she eve - of - election trip to the venice summit of western leader be favourable to she re - election , but harold wilson always assert that a bad set of trade figure a few day before polle cost he an election , while the effect of be centre - stage during the iran hostage affair may have be devastat to jimi carter 's fortune .
the book end with a conclusion which point to he aforementioned radical solution . scorn will heap on the book by people who cannot think of the countryside as anything other than a marketable resource , or that who think they be be environmentally perceptive because they call a gate a peripherial access point and a path a mountain access route . nevertheless , crumley 's be a starkly presented	argument	which should be read and study alongside the barrage of soulless technical documentation already write on this emotive subject . a high and lonely place : the sanctuary and plight of the cairngorm by jim crumley . jonathan cape .
on balance , it be he wish to defend sterl by interventionist method , to check activity at home and keep down the sterle price of import , rather than curb the flow of money , that dictate much of he policy . but what kind of post - monetarism he be espouse be uncertain , too . this uncertainty be reflecte in unprecedent level of	argument	within the government , conduct in the full glare of public attention . the prime minister come close to accuse the chancellor of start the inflationary spiral by an attempt to link the rate for sterl with the value of the german deutschmark . nigel lawson rebut this with some vigour .
the revival of the campaign for scottish devolution indeed , for scottish nationalism , as show in jim sillar ' by - election victory in govan be a notable feature of the late phase of mrs thatcher be regime . here and elsewhere , the government strove to identify it with new theme . in particular , the green	argument	advance by environmentalist , fan by the importance of themes such as land conservation , acid rain , and the protection of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect in the 1989 euro - election , suggest that the message of thatcherite consumption and wealth creation fail to mesh with wide concern for the quality of life . the rise of green issue , indeed , be very naturally appeal to labour or alliance politician , and a powerful reminder of the rich variety of resistance to thatcherism that british society could release . it lead to nichola ridley 's removal from the environment department in july 1989 , in favour of the notoriously wet chris patten .
therefore the little ramsey , when he arrive at repton in 1918 , meet a headmaster destine to play a far very important part in he life than be the fate of many headmaster . fisher be quick , affable , capable . he always see straight to the point of an	argument	. he could remember who everyone be . he could be a severe disciplinarian but he be not a rigid man .
he have to recite from memory in front of he headmaster fifty greek line from the play medea a severe punishment , for learn fifty line of verse in a language imperfect know would take several hour of spare time . the severity may have have a cause hide from the young ramsey . just before he arrive at the school victor gollancz leave it staff , eject because he try to rouse boy 's mind by heady and daring political	argument	. in a war for the nation 's life this be hold by external authority to be provocative . the gollancz scandal , as the blimp think of it , be widely know .
the young say that religious experience be too valid to be dismiss by mere reason , that reason be not all of humanity . the argument go on and on . the elder be contemptuous when the younger reply to he crush	argument	by the reply , the reason why you think like that be that you do not say you prayer . michael 's problem be that he see the n in frank 's position : the love of liberty ; the excitement in the free pursuit of truth ; the shake off of convention and mere conformity ; the feeling that religion be a stuffy valley out of which he have grow . he also have to recognize that he brother be an unselfish person ; so that the axiom , only religious people be unselfish do not wash .
michael 's problem be that he see the n in frank 's position : the love of liberty ; the excitement in the free pursuit of truth ; the shake off of convention and mere conformity ; the feeling that religion be a stuffy valley out of which he have grow . he also have to recognize that he brother be an unselfish person ; so that the axiom , only religious people be unselfish do not wash . the	argument	be a fire in which to test an immature faith . a school prize be offer for a study of the book belief in god by bishop charle gore . when frank hear that michael think of go in for the prize on this set book he be indignant and send a message to michael , who in he sense would read a book by a bishop
nor do he find it awkward that the tutor 's room be immediately below he own in the pepy building . evidently he do not expect to give riotous or alcoholic party at time when the tutor might be in . the undergraduate find he a leg - puller , and a reveller in political	argument	. the chaplain of the college be a pleasant gentleman , he teach of classics be a worthy pedant , and neither mean much to he . the person who mean a lot to he be the master .
he dedicate this formidable intellect to eradicat nonsense from the world , especially nonsense in divinity , which be a world where in that day he could find plenty of target for he scorn . and in the faculty he be surround by several man of substance with much the same opinions though with little hardness in they advocacy . since much christian teacher be kind person who prefer to avoid controversy when they can , and doodle anxiousle during fierce	argument	at meeting , thing tend to go the way of bethune - baker ; partly because he be devastat , and partly because often he be devastatingly right . to be of anglo - catholic opinions in this group be to be a man apart . bethune - baker regard anglo - catholicism as part of the nonsense which it be he mission to destroy .
when he get exhaust from parish work , and feel unwell , a fear would darken he , that the demon , seemingly exorcize , might return . and already he know in he heart that to be a vicar or a curate be not he vocation as a priest for the rest of he life . while this internal	argument	reach it height , he superior argue about he without he knowledge . from opposite end of england the academics say that this be a born teach who ought to be in teach as soon as possible . raven say it in liverpool .
here be an anglo - catholic who insist on the apostolic succession of bishop , and think intercommunion between the churche , before a proper union , to be wrong , and yet refuse to unchurch the protestant churche . rome refuse to take any part in this proceeding , except by unofficial observer . therefore a man like ramsey bring the	argument	about christian unity up against the fundamental question of catholicity versus protestantism in a way which few other could . the protestant leader find he far too rigid . but he be curiously persuasive .
this be a churchill decay physically , slower in the uptake , less able to work long hour , less interested in the peacetime problem of the country , but still well enough to make he own decision . he have an archbishop , fisher , with a good judgement of man and with a lot of information about they . so the discussion , and the	argument	, begin to develop not so much between prime minister and archbishop , as between archbishop and churchill 's patronage secretary anthony bevir . for the first time a civil servant , perforce , begin to affect what happen . the see of durham be the four senior see in the church .
if bell be rul out as too old and ramsey as too new , who else have stature george chase of ripon , good as gold and wise as solomon , but even shyer than ramsey and without he intellectual bite two other circumstance enter this prolong	argument	. this be hardly mention but underneath be not trivial . first , the york diocis have no desire for george bell and every desire for ramsey .
some of this canon be still observe ( what to wear when conduct morning prayer ) and some be long obsolete ( rule about clergy nightcap or yellow stockings on they leg ) . it therefore occur to the canon lawyer a rarefy group of expert that church law , frame by the church organ and then appro by the sovereign , could achieve the canon which would bind conscience . archbishop fisher accept the	argument	and become the enthusiastic leader of the new movement . the work be hard ; hard to frame , hard to get through committee , hard to get accept . no archbishop but fisher would have have the administrative ability or the tenacity to achieve the end .
if one be part responsible already for the general policy of a church or for anything else , it be good to be very responsible . it puzzle he into the new year of 1961 that no one ask he opinion . five year before , fisher draw he into the	argument	. this silence be mark . he assume that this could only be because he be one of the possible .
macmillan talk to sir henry willink , the master of magdalene . perhaps the prime minister expecte that willink would push for a magdalene man but he do not get a firm line out of he . willink as a lawyer have a lot to do with the administration of the church and see the	argument	that an archbishop must be able to bear a load of administration . macmillan consult the queen , who know and like both ramsey and coggan . he also take the trouble to buy and read a new book of theology which ramsey at that moment publish ; an account of the development of english religious think from the late victorian age to the age of william temple from gore to temple .
the roman poet say , dutce est desipere in loco , an opportunity for indiscretion be sometimes pleasant . if the doctrine of collective responsibility can never quite be forget or discard , at little it weigh much light on the wearer in the bracing , not to say rarefy , intellectual atmosphere of the cpc . therefore i do not see why tonight i might not occasionally , if the	argument	should lead that way , be guilty of say in office some of the thing which i have say out of office . the plowden report on control of public expenditure contain , amongst other nugget of wisdom , the follow sentence which i should like to take as i start - point : the social change of the last fifteen year have alter the incidence of hardship , so that there now may well be excessive social service for some purpose and inadequate one for other . i should have think that , in the abstract , no one be like to quarrel with that statement .
otherwise , one wonder , how could there constant be that aside , which seem to reveal that the participant be actual aware the game be up or rather perhaps have never start one of the lesson to be draw from the study of early - twenty - century imperialism be the extraordinary durability of policy and programme which lack all possibility of be realise . the remarkable thing about political house buil on sand , or castle in the air , be how long they often take to collapse ; and this very time - lag become an	argument	in they favour and a supposed refutation of that who draw attention to the absence of foundation . there must be a foundation somewhere , say the populace ; for look , the building continue to stand up . there be yet one far stage of insight and of pessimism which await the student .
in front of a consequence so stark the deep political thinker recoil . in the noble eloquence of he plea for conciliation with the colonist , burke , who base he case on the proposition that they have not be represent at westminster , draw a strange and illogical conclusion . he own	argument	involve the admission that no common government , no common state , comprise both great britain and the colony could subsist . yet he proceed to declare that by refrain from exercise in america the power of the executive which it control in great britain , parliament would preserve the unity of the empire : the much ardently they love liberty , the much perfect will be they obedience .
tape every rehearsal on a portastudio or cassette machine , and distribute copy of the tape amongst the band well in advance of the next rehearsal . this give each musician time to practise so that you all arrive at the rehearsal ready to try out new , revise musical parts . tap rehearsal also reduce the likelihood of	argument	about who play what at the last rehearsal . if you need someone to do the tap , either make it one musician 's responsibility , or try to find someone who would like to mix you sound at gig . at this stage you do not need an experienced sound engineer .
they must always be riske . clue , however remote , may be crucial . the	argument	for preserve shakespeare 's laundry bill be that , eventually , they may find they sherlock holmes . the reader should bear in mind eliot 's exasperation at the graduate student who identify corbire 's rhapsode foraine as an exploration of folk - religion . nevertheless , in the early twenty eliot 's mind be clearly full of not only frazer
he relate this to the state of culture of he own age , face danger of over - specialization , which impoverish both the religious and artistic sensibility by separa each from the other , so that only the vestige of manner may be leave for that who , have they sensibility uninform either by religion or by art , have nothing left but an inherit behaviour which cease to have mean . eliot have write of and against such a milieu when he combin the element of the savage and the city , from the beat tom - tom of portrait of a lady through the ritual of the waste land and sweeney agonistes to the cocktail chatter and jungle martyrdom of the play , the cocktail party , yet to come . revise the original article for notes towards the definition of culture , he complicate he	argument	's texture by involve much material relevan to he personal history and to the history of he work , such as that mention of heart of darkness which look back to the waste land . the first article in the series which become the book demonstrate that eliot 's definition of culture begin with the savage . the second show that at the other pole be the city .
i have in mind two especially : the first involve what might be call the impossibility of desire , the second the notion of desire and/or identity as involve an ineluctable split . like other key notion in psychoanalysis , the sense of desire as a quest for an always impossible self - completion in or through the other have a long though oft an unrecognize history . in this case kaja silverman have useful remark the importance , for jacques lacan 's version of this	argument	, of aristophane 's conception of the person as an original androgynous whole ( in plato 's symposium ) . the human subject be conceive in terms of an essential , intrinsic lack ; it be a fragment of something large and much primordial , who existence be dominate by the desire to recover it miss complement ( the subject of semiotics , 152 ) . but the complement remain forever out of reach and desire thereby become , for lacan , a kind of derangement , with the subject catch in the rail eternally stretch forth towards the desire for something else of metonymy ( ' crit , 167 ) .
in the masculine dilemma ( 1980 ) , subtitle a psychology of masculinity , gregory rochlin offer a different version of the homosexual male , but one which be once again in the service of defend an update heterosexual masculinity , and it primacy within a sexual difference metaphysic . draw on psychoanalysis , rochlin rewrite masculinity in a way which make a virtue of what be hitherto think of a , or experience as , a defect : it much remark insecurity . he	argument	be as follow : a man 's masculinity be indeed insecure ; it be an endless trial , a precariously held , endlessly tested , unstable condition ( p . 91 ) . in this it be almost tragic : the unique vulnerability to tail expectation be the fatal flaw in the masculine ego the test of masculinity know no bound to prive one remain a lifelong necessity . it give rise to many of man 's anxiety and failure as well as to he often extraordinary achievement ( pp . x , xi ) .
the metaphysical construction of subjectivity be at once an admission and production of it disruptive potential , a disruption in and of the very term of it construction . it also suggest , paradoxically , that the less autonomous individuality be think to be , the much it might be mark by a potentially subversive agency . but this be to anticipate the	argument	; for the moment i want only to observe that a conception of the self as social and/or metaphysically constitute produce one idea of transgression , and that of the self as ideally ( if not actual ) unify and autonomous , quite another . early modern : cross - dresse in early modern england in surpasse the love of man lillian faderman record two separate case of woman in france in the sixteen century who be punish tor use transvestite disguise and deploying dildo in they lesbian relation .
in a letter of 25 january 1620 sir john chamberlain remarks a very significant event in the contemporary cross - dress controversy : james i 's instruction to the clergy to suppress woman do it . the k be report as have tell the clergy that they must reproach the practice vehemently and bitterly , and if this do not succeed , he would take far measure . chamberlain refer to this in the same breath as mention an	argument	between the marquess buckingham and hamilton over the selling of honour and abase ancient nobility , by new advancement . class and sexual disruption suggest each other , and with this conclusion : the truth be the world be very far out of order ( letter , ii . 286 9 ) .

but this large managerial change hardly amount to a fundamental review ; rather they be concern to promote competition and value for money . over time the rhetoric of government spokesman have change to boast of how much much manpower ( doctor and nurse ) and money be devote to the nhs , compare to 1979 . the government 's early	argument	that we can not afford it be less persuasive with the budget surplus accumulate in 1987 and 1988 and claim that tax cut be good than great state spend on social and health service have find few taker among the public ( see below p 297 ) . privatization the impact of the thatch government 's new think have much obviously be feel in the privatization programme for the state - own and state - provide service .
on the one hand , a private sector which allow free entry of producer , be subject to competition , sotch profit , and have to respond to consumer or else go bankrupt . on the other side be the public sector , enjoy a monopolistic and low - risk position , respond to political rather than consum preference , and pre - empt investment fund from very productive area . since 1979 the programme of privatization have be defend with a mixture of ideological and pragmatic	argument	. one be that such policy produce an extension of economic freedom and , thereby , political freedom . the nationalize industry , it be claime , deprive the consumer of choice and limit the taxpayer 's freedom to spend he money as he choose because of the industry 's monopoly position and reliance on state subsidy .
in public and private she be a relentless educator . an important task of leadership , in she view , be to win the battle of idea , and this be do by frequently express basic beliefs and principle . she seem to revel in	argument	and lose no opportunity to declare she political principle . initially shadow cabinet colleague be worry by she view of politics as an ideological battle ground and by she disavowal of many cross bench attitudes ( chapter 1 ) . they fear that she would be see as ( indeed be ) abrasive and lack compassion .
( form schoolfriend recall an occasion when mrs thatcher , as a young mp , return to she old school as chief speaker at a dinner for old girl , and correct the headmistress , who be a classical scholar , on the pronunciation of she latin . ) david howell do not remember he time in cabinet with much pleasure some argument just leave such acrimony and ill - feel that i can not believe they really could have be enjoyable i think the general atmosphere in the government of which i be a member be that everything should start as an	argument	. she frequent denunciation of high level of taxation and public expenditure , of big government , and of the diminution of individual freedom and choice be passionate and deep feel ; they be express in attack on the baneful , almost immoral , effect of inflation and of government which debase the currency , or borrow rather than balance they income and expenditure . for all the pejorative talk of she be an ideologue , however , she be a practical conservative .
mrs thatcher have a clear view of she role as prime minister and see he as an activist rather than an arbitrator in cabinet dispute or a spokesman for a collective cabinet view . there be a great difference between the attlee concept and thatcher be robust assertion of 1979 : it must be a conviction government . as prime minister i could not waste time have any internal	argument	or yes , i do drive through thing which i believe in passionately what else do you expect of a prime minister i be not here just to be chairman , i be here because i believe in thing .

the so - call wet favoure an interventionist role for government in the economy and be prepare to increase state spend to boose employment , even if this risk some increase in inflation . but over time the conservative party division on economic policy become less mark , partly because of electoral success and partly because unemployment have fall steadily from june 1986 . it could fair be say that mrs thatcher win the economic	argument	. the simple division between dry and wet do not , however , do justice to the currents of opinion in the contemporary conservative party . one of the effect of the thatch decade have be to redefine the benchmark of division .
whatever the fate of the thatch government , the new right will survive it . in it impact on british politics and economic policy it have already be remarkable successful . the traditional post - war	argument	between different kind of interventionism have be replace by a much broader debate . the 1983 and 1987 gallup election survey show that voter across all party agree on many goal of government . this be significant , give that many commentator in 1983 think that the policy of the conservative and labour party be far apart than at any time over the previous thirty year .
instead of be ask , as he must have hope , whether he would be will to form a government , he be instead ask whether he would be prepare to serve in a national government under macdonald . this be a question to which , for a patriotic conservative leader , there could be only one answer . the king 's action in august 1931 be sometimes defend with the	argument	that he be mere act on the advice of the party leader . but the course of this interviews show that no party leader be unequivocally in favour of a national government lead by macdonald , in the event of the labour government collapse . macdonald say that he might be of no further use , should resign with the whole cabinet ; the night before he interview with the king , baldwin have go to neville chamberlain 's house in eaton square , and hope and pray that he might not have to join a national government ; even after he interview with the king .
on 3 october the king tell the prime minister that he must at all cost find the solution he , and he majesty would refuse to accept he resignation . he must be very patient and brace he up to realise that he be the only person who could tackle the present chaotic state of affair , ' this be the four time the king have tell macdonald that he would not accept he resignation . there be certainly strong	argument	in favour of the course which the king adopt . it be clear that the dominant element in he government , that be , the conservative , be determine upon an election . moreover , macdonald be in principle in favour of an election , but unable to secure agreement upon a formula which could reconcile protectionist and free trader up to the very last moment .
he do not do so . indeed , he put pressure on sir herbert samuel to abandon it term . despite the	argument	in favour of the course which the king adopt , he encouragement to macdonald to hold the government together and to fight the election as a government have quite momentous consequence for the politics of the 1930 . although the king 's intention be not partisan , the consequence be such as to offer very considerable benefit to the conservative party . the 1931 general election give the conservative a huge overall majority in the house of commons , enabl they to pursue they tariff policy with little hindrance .
as a result , they be transfer to different prison . orlando azcu and two other be take to kilo 7 maximum security prison in camaguey where , on 17 january , they go on hunger - strike . they be say to have be forcible dress in the prison uniform and hold for at little 17 day with they	arm	chain to the cell bar to prevent they from remove the uniform . orlando azcu be also say to have be beat by prison guard on at little three occasion . in early february he be transfer to pinar del ro provincial prison after agree to give up he protest and end he hunger - strike .
i have very unpleasant recollection of sit for he , for it be of utmost importance not to move but to fix he right in the eye and listen to he complain , say as he always do that he be get nowhere . it be not much fun , particularly at i age thing would deteriorate rather quickly , for alberto would return to he hotel in the evening with a sculpture eight to twelve inch tall under he	arm	and come back the next day with a piece no much than three or four inch high i late realize that i have pos during a crucial period , and the tiny bronze that resulte ( for that size prevail ) continue daily to touch i . another example from the 1980 allow we to hear a conversation between the critic norbert lynton and the painter ken kiff .
time will tell , sir , a colleague remark , and hawksmoor reply : time will not tell . time never tell . once very he raise he	arm	involuntarily , as if in greeting . it be hard to think that the novelist intended the reader to find this even much gnomic and exasperat than the colleague seem to find it . but there may indeed be some such aim .
the selection be right if it truly work for the compet student , and it be the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the performance of the piece . the much important thing be you firm knowledge that the selection be within you present range . it be not much use arrive somewhere at ten in the morning clutch the collect work under you	arm	and wish you have a wig and be born thirty year earlier in order to play lear or for that matter the duke of gloucester . major role for old woman be not so common in shakespeare , but i think it be good not to choose a character such as queen katherine from henry viii , who need a richness of seniority to convey the dramatic inter . if you do want to portray an old figure , it would be preferable to try hermione in the winter 's tale she be a much fantastical character , without the added complication of historical authenticity , and so allow for great flexibility of characterisation .
it be possible for such sentiment of approval of this past to coexist with abhorrence for many current act of violence . but the political significance of this culture be that where opinion count and where the catholic nationalist remnan actual experience the coercive power of protestant loyalist and the british army in the northern statelet , there violence have all the much support . when it do , it tend to be a reaction to perceive injustice , such as internment without trial , or the conviction of a son by a sole judge in a trial held in total secrecy and on the evidence of unseen witness , or a simple case of one 's house be bad maule by careless soldier search for	arm	. this reactive violence be thus justify by it subject and the justification subsist in consciousness along with they roman catholic profession of faith and identity . the provisional ira 's commitment to violence against the british and against the protestant loyalist alliance , which the provisional rhetorically and conveniently subsume under the term the british , be frequently assume to be base on either marxist or nationalist principle and in both case to be secularist or areligious .

it be important to practise adjust the airbrake during the float and to kick you hard if you ever land short of you point with brake still apply . it simply mean that you have frozen on the airbrake lever and have undershot when you could have save the situation . this be the same as throttle	arm	paralyse on a power aircraft when the pilot undershoot and crash he aircraft . he could have push the throttle forward and avoid the accident by use the engine . it be also worthwhile attempt the occasional no airbrake touch down to get a good idea of how far you glider will float .
such special knowledge hold far difficultie , for it highlight the specifically political nature of any ethnographic account of such an institution , bring to the forefront that expectation of loyalty which the executive demand of any individual who have hold of the account . ethical problem will surface , for no power - base organization like to have it idiosyncrasy make public , and the anthropologist who be a member of the family and not mere a temporary visitor to the backyard exotican can find that write anything at all become crucially problematic . expectation of confidentiality and silence prevent many accounts from reach fruition , for as the revelation of spycatch ( wright and greenglass 1986 ) reveal , it be not necessarily what be write which caus the pain ; rather it be the breach of the convention which require member in various	arm	of the executive to say nothing about they practice . this return we to arendt 's observation that secrecy be a prerequisite of totalitarianism , for that involve in the executive use of power know that to reveal be antagonistic to it maintenance . the insider/anthropologist be therefore somewhat schizophrenic , something of a jekyll and hyde , for he know that publication and explication might be career - suicidal but be necessary intellectual task .
in they own research department the police continuously attempt to measure aspect of they activity , large to demonstrate cost effectiveness in line with criterium impose by the limit on public spending ( ho circular 114/83 ) and the prevalent socio - economic world view of society . this have mean that many study tend to concentrate on the objective assessment of a fiscally quantifiable reality . for example , the audit commission ( an	arm	of the treasury ) spend some time in 1987/8 with i and other in a police research department assesse an osu ( operational support unit ) administrative system which they claim have revolutionize police decision make and release manpow for patrol equal to 6.358 million . however , a colleague look at this osu in relation to they cultural impact , see there be many aspect of a qualitative nature which could not easy be express in fiscal term ( adam 1988 : 11 ) : direct submission of report to the 0 .
since this condemnation of research opportunity , few study have penetrate deep beneath the sensitive skin of police culture , and even though chatterton in he note to i these argue there have be a considerable amount of participant police research , i would question whether many of this inquiry achieve the fi grain and detail ' of the insider 's account , for they can never really know or tell if they have be exclude from the inner working of police practice or prevent from gain access to the hide reality contain inside the head of the constable . because of the litism which such an organization of control wield , it be not surprise there be difficulty in incorporat the outside research , or in accept he critical finding . and certainly that other main	arm	of executive control the army seem little good at this than the police , for the number of participant account of they deep structure remain negligible , support mccabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be ask of all of this costly institution , who be to be control by who and for what reason meanwhile , as reiner ( 1985 ) suggest , the politicization of the police have proceed at a pace , and can be illustrate by they grow willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy . this trend be far display in they grow tendency to agree to be use as a pseudo - military arm of government in it socio - economic and industrial/political dispute with whole section of society .
and certainly that other main arm of executive control the army seem little good at this than the police , for the number of participant account of they deep structure remain negligible , support mccabe 's ( 1980 ) contention that we should be ask of all of this costly institution , who be to be control by who and for what reason meanwhile , as reiner ( 1985 ) suggest , the politicization of the police have proceed at a pace , and can be illustrate by they grow willingness to respond to political dissent as a form of crime or deviancy . this trend be far display in they grow tendency to agree to be use as a pseudo - military	arm	of government in it socio - economic and industrial/political dispute with whole section of society . in 1985 , cressida dick , a probationary constable , wrote a prize - winning essay which clearly show an awareness of this politicization , and ask the sort of question which few senior officer seem to be think or voice . in she essay implication of the miner 's strike , she point out that :
not jay . i have be sava by love , she would declaim , when she will have a few . but many year ago , a wise old man say fall in love and you may fall flat on you face , but pick you up and rush towards the next one , knee bleed , face bruise ,	arm	open , heart on fire . dear walter the art teach , old - fashioned gallant , shoute bugger in class , cast lofty pearl to the in - group of disaffect teenager . she will take he literal , although now she question whether that have be wise .
no , you have to sleep sometime , he say . the day before the date , jay go into lucy 's office and see she cry , silky red head on the desk , fist clench . want to put she	arm	around she , hug she , what the hell have super - brat be up to now she tiptoe out unnoticed . late lucy borrow coffee , a picture of composure .
then back to the exhausted heat of lucy , and sleep . sleep . sun through the curtain , she wake with lucy in she	arm	. sleep , i darl . she wake lucy with coffee , and very love , sure and slow .
god , i love you . you give i you breast and hold i close . you be warm in i	arm	, you body right next to i . if i lips have word for the wondrous feeling of you breast and nipple i will say they . but there be no word good enough for perfection .
we both shake when we be nervous . and go cold . but i	arm	hold i , and the shivering stop and weld we still and close and still clos . b.l . i have this passionate blouse - ripp fantasie , the sort where you dissolve on a bearskin rug and explode with ecstasy .
she want dionne to have the good , oh yeah , jay , and be that you just that she will see dionne so often sad and unsure . and laugh and ecstatic in she	arm	. and the bloody rest of it . well , dear , say francis , consider , she must be at little twelve
do lucy think of he as that heterosexually convenient phenomenon , the non - orgasmic woman ; have sex be awful for she jump on she ! how the hell do you jump on a lucy , a lady , a lucy , someone who appear fragile as glass , go warm and soft like a trust animal in you	arm	, then tough as steel with she polished no do you want to have a weekend with i i feel sort of fixe that it would be the good thing you know it would .
i do not know what to do , say lucy , hide she face , tear pour through she clench finger . you will have to decide for both of we . ok , say jay , wrapp she	arm	around lucy , sudden so tiny , i will tell you . if you have to go home now , and i wish you would not , then _ i tomorrow and give i a date . ok
no stay of execution . she hear lucy 's chair scrape and feel she arm round she shoulder . from she ice age , she wrench he to turn and wrap both	arm	round lucy 's waist , she pound head but against the soft silk of she blouse . hold tight , say lucy , sudden mummy . jay grip , burrow she head in lucy 's belly : here so safe and want inside she belove jerei have grow ; she brow nudge lucy 's breast , where jerei have suck he full and strong , where she have find a contentment warm as summer wind across white sand ; here she have swum easy as a seal , crystal sea halcyon over she head .
she weep tore at she slender shoulder , white linen crumpl to fold of despair . what do i do now , think jay , we have re - run who 's afraid of virginia woolf , and what do i do now she body take over , she cross to lucy , lie beside she , curl round she , hold she close and lucy turn , weep into she	arm	and jay rock and sh - sh - e she , she flight of vituperation spend in the face of this pain . sudden lucy unball she fist from she face and kiss she , open mouth , hard . jay shush she against she shoulder .
come here , let i hold you , say jay . she feel lucy 's heat - soft breast nudge she . felt lucy 's slender	arm	round she shoulder . feel she naked leg against lucy 's . she feel like every adagio ever write .
feel complete , replete , like a cat sleep in the sun have all four paw bury under it fur bel , sun too hot to move , tail wrap over it sleep nose , i go back to we bed to curl up next to where you have be . have not shift one crease from the pillow where you sit and smoke and drink coffee , i hand on you warm nake littbre . i lie as if you be there and love the shape you back have make , have a sense of you silky warmth , i body curl round the heat and wonder of you in i	arm	. one or you down - fine hair be on the pillow : i pick it up like gold - dust - sweet relic ! another - i kneld delight and collect you beautiful hair .
god , she be do this once too often . this be oh hell ! the body sag against the door , the heavy	arm	rest around neck and shoulder . they handle the massive limp dbris . consciousness flicker .
make sure that you know what this be and what they mean . brief , if the referee point he finger this indicate that someone have do something wrong . if he extend he	arm	with the finger together it be an award . final , if the referee bring both fist together in the middle of the chest , this mean that both contestant score at the same time , so no award will be make . a much detailed list of japanis expression appear at the end of this book ( p. 109 ) .
even during flurry of technique , both hand remain on they respective side of the centre - line . arm movement econoi of	arm	movement be important since the very you flail they about , the long it take to cock they for an effective punch . move you arm as little as be necessary to achieve you purpose , and always move they together so that if the front hand be knock down an incom punch , the rear be execut a counter - punch . you simply do not have the time for the one pause two sequence so belove in basic training .
follow the opponent 's shape , not he attacke limb , because although an individual technique may have be successfully evade , the opponent still remain potentially dangerous . scoop the opponent 's front kick , draw it back and up to break he balance if you be likely to face he open side , then circle you block	arm	so you twist he away a front kick can also be counter effective by move back on the diagonal . face the opponent in opposite stance ( i.e . if you opponent 's right leg be forward you lead with you left and vice versa ) .
the third example use a short but wide diagonal movement of the front foot to take you clear of the opponent 's incom reverse punch . use a long , thrust snap punch to the opponent 's face and if the chance present it , follow up quickly with a reverse punch . if the opponent 's attack be a face punch , then hit he extend	arm	with you forearm , glance you punch over the top of he and into the target . ( a ) step diagonally forwards , catch the opponent 's advance punch with you lead forearm ( b ) continue you fist into the opponent 's face
the second requirement be that of good time . some competitor just be not quick enough off the mark , or they hold back instead of thrust in strongly . either of this fault mean that the attacking technique be well develope before you move into it , and so you front barr	arm	or groin suffer according . move directly into a high roundhouse kick and stop - punch it stop a front kick by barr down with you lead guard whilst reverse - punch to the opponent 's chest
to do this you slide back you rear foot so that the stance lengthen ( this make it very stable in a longitudinal direction ) and you centre of gravity drop . if the action be sharp enough you opponent 's punch will graze over the top of you head , help on it way by a fast rise block . as well as deal with the punch , the rise block travel diagonally up and forwards into the opponent , catch he high on the attack	arm	. do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring you chin close to the opponent 's other fist . there be no need to withdraw you block arm fully as you reverse punch ; you probably will not have enough time to anyway !
as well as deal with the punch , the rise block travel diagonally up and forwards into the opponent , catch he high on the attacking arm . do not lean forwards as you block since this will bring you chin close to the opponent 's other fist . there be no need to withdraw you block	arm	fully as you reverse punch ; you probably will not have enough time to anyway ! the main thing be to shift you centre of gravity forwards behind the punch , so that it be deliver with plenty of power . simply rock forwards on to you lead knee to achieve this .
shout to underline you score . drop under the opponent 's high punch , block high on he	arm	with rise block whilst reverse - punch strongly with the other making your punch score as we see in the chapter deal with rule , it be not enough for you punch to be an effective score technique ; it must be see to be so , and this entail make it success obvious .
even if the slide be not feasible , you can still throw you centre of gravity forward , so that weight increase on the lead leg . the fifth attention - grabber be the exaggerate hip action which should accompany every punch . this show that the punch be not mere an	arm	movement , but a powerful , co - ordinate body action . the punch hip , be it the lead hip of a front punch or the traile hip of a reverse punch , must swivel forwards , so that you centre - line directly face the opponent . you may well decide to twist even far when use the front punch , but beware that you situation be weaken should the opponent immediately counter attack .
the back fist this punch be not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one . the back fist unroll from the shoulder , propell as much by the body turn away as by the	arm	action it . many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the arm action . a back fist will out - range a reverse punch perform by an opponent of equal height but it be not often score because many referee do not consider it powerful enough .
this punch be not a linear strike like the previous two but a circular one . the back fist unroll from the shoulder , propell as much by the body turn away as by the arm action it . many karateka get this wrong and make use only of the	arm	action . a back fist will out - range a reverse punch perform by an opponent of equal height but it be not often score because many referee do not consider it powerful enough . nevertheless it remain an excellent opening strike because , even much than the snap punch , it cock the hip for a powerful reverse punch .
lean in behind the strike in order to get the maximum range , and raise you other hand as a guard . unfortunately , the cock action that begin a back fist movement present an unmistakable cue to the opponent . the punch elbow must be flex before it can be extend fully , and any attempt to strike with a semi - extend	arm	be sure to fail because of the obvious weakness of the technique . the question be , how do you disguise the elbow flexion one answer be to open with a reverse punch to the mid - section .
also , the opponent may fall in an unexpected direction , so that you have to spin around and perhaps take a step to reach he . by that time , of course , the element of surprise be lose and he guard be ready and wait . the remainder of the sequence then degenerate into a mle of pump	arm	and leg . the hook at this point it be necessary to distinguish between foot sweep and hooks .
if they take a whirl at the minister , he would have a fine sight of the fun . two day ago when they have cart out menzy the minister and flem the young teach from along the road at dull and dance round they like child at a halloween fire and stike they up on horse , face backwards , and parade they past the door and down the road to aberfeldy , he have fling a soft carrot he and catch the man on the side of he face . he have deserve all he get be that what minister and teacher be pay for to draw up the militium list and condemn the young man to the barrack and the camp , to swamp fever in the indy and they leg and	arm	blown off young donald he eye be clear black - brown , like a lochan stain with peat , he hair be curly like a bull 's poll , and he have be a lovely lad until he father go away , clever with he hand , whittle piece of wood and glue they to make little windmill and watermill . the wheel he have mount on a bit of rod from stewart 's smithy still turn freely in the burn at the side of the kail - yard .
look they be still flock in . a ripple of new arrival be make the front row press forwards . cameron and menzy be squeeze back nearly into the house , and big mary , find he hard up against menzy , take he	arm	, clear a space with a sideway butt of she hip , and twirl once round with he . come away , james ! she say loud . this be good than a ceilidh .
a pulse of pressure from behind throw they against the factor , he turn and jump for the door , beat on it , it opened abruptle , and he fall inside . cameron turn and rise on tiptoe the grandtully crowd have arrive in force , the duke of lennox in the lead , he be strid across the grass with an oak - tree branch slant across he chest like a sceptre , it green spray nodd on he shoulder . a piper march beside he , the patch black bag of he pipe under he	arm	, the chanter blow a reel . the duke be revell in the occasion , he toothless mouth curve up in a great leer like the mask of comedy . when the boy see he , they run towards he , call out shrilly up the duke ! he swing he sceptre at they and they duck , shriek .
when the boy see he , they run towards he , call out shrilly up the duke ! he swing he sceptre at they and they duck , shriek . shoal of people be come up the drive from the west gate cameron recognize face that he know from the sawmill at kenmore . amongst they walk a gentleman in an expensive greatcoat , he	arm	firm hold another hostage . good tactics , whether plan or not the much gentry be pin down here , the fewer be leave to muster the volunteer or ride off with news to the deputy at blairgowrie . dust hang in the air now , make it yellow and the sun orange .
he should be here by now . and he be a small figure in a drab coat , lurk at the side of the crowd , speak to nobody . macdiarmid wave he forward with a command sweep of he	arm	and he come and sit at the end of the table . there be a pause while everyone present wonder how to proceed . abrupt the laird smile , look from face to face along the front row , and say , well , well it be a fine morning for it .
before the crowd could drift off , cameron get up on the massive stone gate - post and call on they to swear an oath . the word draw on he memory of a secret meet he have go to at the end of he first year in glasgow . it have look like a melodrama a little group in a candle - light attic , hold up they	arm	with fist clench and swear to do or die . but they have mean it , and he be eager now to bring everybody together in a fine , hard point of resolve , in case zeal slacken and dy away in the holiday atmosphere of this soft , comfortable afternoon . the hill they look asleep , the heather glowe dust - blue in the hazy light , and the people , after a night of little sleep and hour of walk and stand , now look stun as they sit on the grassy bank , lean on dyke , or lie on they back in the hayfield , munch oatcake and drink the last of they water .
be we all resolve to finish this day 's work he look from one tired face to another . a few have turn on they side in the hay and cradle they head on they	arm	. all right . we have start well .

they tramp along to ballechin among the fern and shelter oak , smell the cheesey smell of cow among the mist . hope steuart have fel a tree across the track , two man with cudgel be stand sentry behind it , they drop the club and run when the whole wood come at they , the darkness between the tree turn into people , people everywhere , herds and thicket of they surround the low tower - house . hope steuart have lean two loaded musket against the doorjamb ; he turn to pick one up but the duke 's two son be on he , twist he	arm	behind he . he struggle and roar out , i see you , james menzy , i charge you with sedition , and the duke roar back , we charge you with tyranny , trail he round the house , lad , show he servant who be the master now . they cart he like a scarecrow , he heel score the gravel , but he be as stubborn as a pig in a cart , he would never squeal without a hard prod ; donald stewart the blacksmith have to grip he wrist to make he sign the paper .
well , well , well he put he foot between the two bottom rung of the ladder and then catch at the upright to save he from stagger . careful he try again but cameron take he	arm	and tell he not to hurry unduly , the joist have only be pin in place and they be still wait for the long nail from grandtully . work slowe to a halt until donald steuart clatter up on he cart and begin to lift down hefty canvas bag from the tailboard . sorry , angus , he be say , i lad from ballinluig never turn up , i have to get i father to blow the bellow ouch ! some of they be still hot that bag have char , spread they out to cool , or keep they for tomorrow .
james be have a brown mark on the leg the shape of an iron . when allan grin knowingly at it , he say , oh aye this house need a woman . , maybe we will find a willing girl at the wedding , allan suggest . donald 's other daughter be like they father too hefty in the	arm	. no man will ever cow they . do i say a stewart

to charm you a kingdom the other take it up , humm or sing , and walk in time to it until old donald get breathless and they have to saunter for a while . jean have she	arm	round donald 's waist now and from time to time she skip , rouse by the fight spirit of the menfolk . well before noon , beside a small church who roof sag under clump of grass and willow - herb , they come to the bridge over to grandtully and look across at the dense little settlement , lumpish house make of undress river boulder with brown smoke stream through they heather thatch , hovel of branch littere through the tree , a few solid cottage with level roof - tree . it be a place of moss and mud and stand pool , myriad of fly twirl in the sun - ray , and dog and child run out to greet the newcomer in a raucous chorus .

the good exercise for develop width be wide grip pull - up to the back of the neck and lat pull - down . exercise to develop thickness include seat row . bend - over row , t bar row and single	arm	row . this latter exercise also work the low trapezius muscle and the rhomboid . the main muscle of the upper back be the upper trapezius .
the skeletal width of the shoulder be hereditary but an illusion of breadth can be create by fully develope the should muscle . this muscle be call the deltoid and have 3 head ; anterior ( front ) , lateral ( side ) and posterior ( rear ) . the head form a cap which cover the should joint , and they be attach at one end to the upper	arm	and at the other end to 3 point to the front , top and back of the shoulder . the function of the deltoid be to raise the arm to the front , the side and the rear . all 3 of the head of the deltoid be involve in should movement , but the direction of the arm movement determine which head be be use the much .

arm train the balance between biceps and triceps development be perhaps one of the much difficult to achieve in physique development . the triceps make up 60 % of the upper	arm	while the biceps make up only 40 % and yet it be still the case that many people tend to have overdeveloped biceps . there be two reason for this . firstly , train the biceps be very enjoyable and the result be easy see .
firstly , train the biceps be very enjoyable and the result be easy see . secondly , the biceps respond very quickly to train and be relative easy to develop compare to the triceps . upper	arm	training should be in the ratio of 3 : 2 for triceps to bicep . it be always good to train the triceps first because this be usually the least develope group . there be 3 head to the triceps ; 2 of they have they origin on the humerus and the third originate on the should blade .
high repetition must be use because the muscle type be dens and very resilient ( like the calf ) . wrist roll be probably one of the good exercise to perform . this involve hold out a bar at	arm	's length and then rotat it . a weight can be tie to the bar by a piece of rope and then raise and lowere to make the exercise very difficult . one final point to remember be that it be very easy to overtrain the arm .

at risk of seem a killjoy , i would urge reader to think through the implication of all home - make safety device which set out to resolve some well - acknowledge safety problem only to create other of a less obvious by much hazardous nature . remember that anything that bode to threaten concentration in wood - machin be a prime risk , let we consider a router cutter revolve at anything up to 24, 000rpm sit midway between 12 high unstable - spring device who proper purpose in life be the support of wet laundry on a clothes line . it take little imagination to foretell the likely consequence of just one peg disintegrate and flinge it spre or it free	arm	into the cutter gap during a pass ; or the possible knock - on effect ( s ) on the rest of the makeshift assemb and the astonished operator if this should happen . there have be good hold - down device of a home - make nature in woodworker in the past the good of they doubtless design after some careful thought about an acceptable specification . mr wiseman do not only have the safety of he hand to consider : in this case he might stand to lose he sight or sustain laceration from bit of fly clothespeg , block and cramps into the bargain .
you do not want to get trap by detail . start general round off , and at this stage , some form of modelling could be tackl ; work on deep fold , light crease and facial feature . careful observe the model , george concentrate on the tiny crease in the ear , on	arm	and leg . the paw ; simulat the stitch and seam , mere suggest the heavy black braid that define the nose of the original bear . all the detail that help breathe life into the little fellow can be mark with a pencil or biro .
the bracket must end up with they two oblique edge absolutely square , and each bracket must be identical . i be make 24 of this and need a repetitive method . i be not sure that a radial -	arm	see be accurate enough for this at the good of time , but , at the moment , i rattle up and down it rail like a train in the siding , and be definitely not fit for the job . i shoot the long edge down on the planer . if you need to change angle to land on the line , you take two slight pass , the first either stoppe with the wood still on the back table , or start with it already on the front table , depend which way you want to tild .
each one have inherent hazard . i try to arrange guide on the drum sander but quickly give up . i bandsee compete with the radial -	arm	for clatter and bang so the big router win with a large chamfer bit . two strip of waste wood be slowly f over the revolve cutter and crampe to the table . this pointed finger be adjust to be i guide and , apart from the very end of each cut , be quite reliable .
i be steal everything i can ! tall and elegantly mustachioe , david esterly be a softle spoken californian in he mid - forty who passion for grinle gibbon take he by surprise even today . i be walk down piccadilly in 1973 with the woman who be late to become i wife when she grab i by the	arm	and steer i into st james 's church to see the carving . what follow dictate the course of he life . it be a conversion experience , he say , i have see he carving in a vague sort of way already esterly be then a post - graduate student at cambridge and surround by some of gibbon 's good work but i find i look at they there in st james be as if for the first time .
for the first time we be try to preserve the historical integrity of the carving . the restoration work have bring to light trick of the gibbon trade . as they lie on the bench within	arm	's reach , the foliage composition initially shock by they scale . tulip and rushes seem implausible large . but that , say the quiet american , be all part of the art .
in follow stravinsky 's guideline , ashton find many new , sometimes frivolous , way of perform class - room step . the corp de ballet neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur le pointe , raise the working knee and rest the toe on the calf of the other leg , before move forwards . they travel forwards instead of en place in chapp relev after break the rule that the	arm	never cross the centre line of the body and be always ( except in arabesque ) round . if ashton 's scne de ballet be compare with balanchine 's ballet imperial , it will be see that balanchine rare break away from the classical technique as practise in petipa 's day when tchaikovsky wrote the music . ashton , like stravinsky , take into account the technical development which have take place .
dancer easy understand how a series of swift pa de bourre courus ( i.e . run on the toe ) as dance by the queen of the wili in giselle , differ from the same step perform piqu ( i.e . each foot pick up sharply at each change of weight ) , as in many of petipa 's solo . but it be not always easy to decide which be the much appropriate , nor how the two way mention can lead to other version . for example , in she solo in ashton 's cinderella the winter fairy mofe across the stage in a series of pa de bourre an tournant terre , the foot weave they in - and - out pattern as the	arm	flick to and fro sparkl with frost . in symphonic variation , the dancer perform pa de bourre piqus sur le pointe very gently because they be mark the rhythmic beat as the soloist dance to the melodic phrase . this be an excellent example where both the overall and shorter phrase rhythm be explicitly bring to life by the dance design ( see page 68 ) .

but such jump can also travel some way forward , backward or sideway and can become sparklingly light when the knee be sharply bend upwards at the height of the jump . this be require of the four fairy , the fairy godmother and the star in ashton 's cinderella . however if this way of jump from two foot to two foot have not be combin with well pick - up pa de bourre piqus and relevs retir as well as extremely accurate , quick port de bra with straighter and very angled than rounded	arm	, they would have seem out of place . when move dancer from two foot to one in both open and closed sissonne , the choreographer can make the movement dart over the floor as aurora do in she final solo in the sleep beauty . in les patineur and les rendezvous ashton make he dancer travel upwards as well in an effort to show off they ability to keep up with the music and beat each other to the exit .
it can be that magic moment in such dance as the rose adage in the sleep beauty when aurora triumphantly raise she hand from the four prince 's grasp and hold the final attitude for several second reveal she complete command over the force of gravity . there be hundred of instance of this kind of pose create by many different choreographer . there be the moment in the act ii pa de deux or swan lake where odette appear to fly away in an arabesque before siegfry seize she	arm	and draw she body close to he in an embrace . there be also the excit pos that come at the end of some of ashton 's pa de deux as the two character declare they love , for example , when oberon cradle titania in he arm at the end of the dream and , even very excitingly , when cola lift lise high on one arm it the end of they dance in act ii of la fille mai garde as if to crow she queen of the harvest in some modern classical ballet too little attention be pay to the momentary holding of a pose as the focus of a picture to sum up as it be what have go before .
for example : in choros he focuse attention on many ancient greek dance ritual and accent the playful use of movement whilst at the same time show that such warlike , athletic courtship and other activity be a wonderful game to be play by the performer . in consort lesson this quick change of aulement give much great variety and dimension to the overall design particularly where the solo girl dance with four boy . very recently , in he the son of horus he have find way of incorporat the profiled attitude and pos see in ancient egyptian design with straight turn - in leg , elongate line and angle	arm	, all in contrast to the turnedout legs and curve bodies of classical dance . as ashton and macmillan in many of they ballet , he have create a style appropriate to one particular ballet . unless he choose another ancient egyptian theme he be unlikely to use the same style again .
petipa 's remark that without port de bras the dancer be dumb be only one of the wise comment he make when work on he choreographic design . fokine echoe this remark when he say every step and pose be a gesture ( see page 58 ) . de valois sum up the idea of this two great choreographer by say : only synchronisation of	arm	and leg will give symmetry to step and pose , streng to the jump , speed to the pirouette , calm to the adage and spaciousness to the dance . to ensure that he audience would appreciate each sentence in he dance , petipa usually repeat each at little twice and usually four time . but towards the end of the second or four repeat he make some small alteration in the port de bra so that the dancer could move easy into the next sentence .
this be particularly noticeable in he variation for the six fairy in the sleep beauty . petipa clearly reflect in dance the gift that each fairy bring to the christening . the first fairy be slow and gracious to denote beauty ; she encircle she face with she hand and display the line of she	arm	( the traditional gesture for beauty ) . the second fairy bring grace and dance slight faster in such a way that she show off the line of she body as it face forwards and then backwards ( the traditional gesture ) . the third fairy dance slowly sur le pointe and use conventional hand movement to show she bring the gift of plenty , just as the godmother at a russian christening scatter breadcrumb over the cradle .
but if ashton have not make this very distinctive change in he port de bra , the seasonal difference would not have be so notable . the above example be only a few of that show how conventional port de bra can be change . a study of ashton 's way of use they , or of macmillan 's , reveal how unnecessary it be to keep pass the	arm	through 1st position . nor be it necessary always to keep the arm round except in arabesque . examples take from both choreographer 's works describe the particular feeling , mood and emotion of the character they dancer be portray .

examples take from both choreographer 's works describe the particular feeling , mood and emotion of the character they dancer be portray . arm flick to and fro as the winter fairy and the star of ashton 's cinderella give the illusion of twinkle light in the frosty air . the poignant shake of the hand above upraised head follow by the pressing downward , outwards and then backward of the	arm	make an overwhelm plea for pity in macmillan 's requiem . the fact that the two lead english choreographer create so many unusual port de bra as a means of expression be what have make so many royal ballet dancer so successful in ballet with a story . come from a country where the use of the appropriate word be very important than a gesture in daily life , both choreographer have resolve that word must be replace by gesture within the choreographic design .
any untoward or awkward transition be immediately noticeable because it destroy the calm dignity that the human body need if it be to be show at it good . this do not mean that speed must be avoid , nor that the unexpected need offend the eye . a sudden change of aulement , an unusual turn in - out of leg or	arm	, or quick jump up and then down to the floor follow by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement have in the whole design . swift change in the dimensions cover in any linear design be nowhere very obvious than in ashton 's five abstract ballet and he example be now be follow by david bintley in he choros and consort lesson . in fact such unusual movements often arouse the audience to gentle laughter as swift change add a touch of humou as two or very dancer compete to capture the attention of both the audience and they colleague .
late the mass of dancer mere move upstage sur le pointe to a pose and further port de bra , then return downstage to another slowly unfold set of port de bra and arabesque . it be when this mass of dancer divide and move to the side that the open space available for dancing be expose fur the first time . before this the slowmove dancer in they wide spread tutus and veil	arm	have hide it from view . it exposure prepare the audience for the brilliant solo to follow . when marie camargo shorten she skirt and remove the heel from she shoe , jump and batterie first enter the vocabulary .
the demi - caractre style have it root in classical technique , but must be coloure by very clearly define and individual movement which allow the dancer to show they be play the part of some character who have some claim to live in the real world and therefore can be recognise as such . in other word they usually , dance classically from they foot to the waist and above that be free to express they as people of much definite behaviour , work , play and age ( de valois in a lecture to teacher , 1947 ) . the head , body and	arm	of the character portray should show the status they have in the society to which they belong whether it be rural , urban or fantastic , as well as they behaviour , customs , work or play . dauberval be la fille mal gard ( 1789 ) be the first ballet in this style . dauberval 's exclusion from the acadmie royale ( late the paris opera ) be justify by that in charge because they feel he idea of make farmer , peasant and the like the hero and heroine of he ballet be beneath the dignity of an opera house who stage have hitherto be occupy with the deed of noble hero , heroine and court .
dauberval 's exclusion from the acadmie royale ( late the paris opera ) be justify by that in charge because they feel he idea of make farmer , peasant and the like the hero and heroine of he ballet be beneath the dignity of an opera house who stage have hitherto be occupy with the deed of noble hero , heroine and court . bournonville coloure he ballet with movement characteristic of many different personality and nationality . in he particular style of demi - caractre dance he use classical footwork for many of the time but , from the waist upwards through the body ,	arm	and head , he try to convey how he performer work and play in the environment to which they belong . for example : in napoli they be italian , in far from denmark they be dane influence by the dance of south america . this way of create much plebeian character be fully demonstrate in ashton 's comic masterpiece la fille mal garde , where this style of dance be show in two different aspect , the light - heart yet technically highly expert dance of lise and cola and the comically eccentric work of alain and the cock and hens .
but by the time fokine produce the firebird he have develope he mimed dance much far . it have become the much important part of he choreography . he firebird flew and still fly in all she glory before be trap pitifully in the	arm	of the tsarevich . she release send she soar in grand jet an avant through the magic garden . this flight of the magic bird hold and stili hold audienc spellbound .
as traditional italian dance be often sing , the performer pose solemnly fur a second or two at the end of each phrase . this be a feature wide use by nineteen - century italian balletmaster and by bournonville . but the latter 's pause be often to hold the dancer in perfect 5th position of both	arm	and foot . spanish style the stereoty spanish style be possible see at it good in petipa 's don quixote , much particularly in the famous pa de deux fur the ballerina and she partner .
spanish style the stereoty spanish style be possible see at it good in petipa 's don quixote , much particularly in the famous pa de deux fur the ballerina and she partner . the tone be set by the continual use of the pose with head held high , back slight arch ,	arm	in close 4th or a stretch fully upwards in 5th sur le pointe for kitri or on demi - pointe for basil . the brilliant bravura variation when kitri spring light forwards sur le pointe whilst fann he and basil attempt to make he zapateado ( heel - tapp ) appear authentic by the slight crouch pose of he body , add even great panache to they effort . swanhilda strike similar pos with she mantilla and fan in copplia and so do the spanish dancer in swan lake .
the work leg be thrust outwards on the first beat of a bar , heel click and stamp to accent the appropriate beat . although the solo danseuse perform sur le pointe , they still mark the appropriate beat by stab they to into the floor , i.e . they dance a series of retir passs forwards or backwards without descend and use typical hungarian port de bra . this be also strongly accent as the	arm	straighten into 2nd position before be bent , with hand sometimes clasp behind the head , sometimes place akimbo on the waist or sometimes with one on the waist and the other behind the large bow at the back of the head - dress . the danseuse perform some of the traditional step such as the sideway move pa de bourre dance sur le pointe and the sideway cabrioie rare use in classical ballet . the unusual feature of traditional hungarian style be the strong distinction make between the two part of many folk dance .
this make the dancer appear as if they be a moving frieze . something that david bintley be also to achieve late in he son of horus ( 1985 ) . ashton too have create two oriental styl ballet in which the delicacy of the hand and	arm	draw attention to the way such subtle movement can take the place of word . he inter in port de bra nearly always produce something now to say , whether it be to tell a story , describe the character and/or create a style exclusive to one work . japanis the first of ashton 's ballet in oriental style be madome chrysanthme , in which he utilise many traditional japanese gesture make very fascinate by emphasis of he dainty ballerina 's footwork .
it also convey the mood and emotion of the girl , a very rare happen in true folk dance . the participant in folk dance can and certainly do show elation . in la fille mal garde mother simone do this when she triumphantly finish she clog dance on the	arm	link to celebrate . the gesture of such pastoral character as lise and cola in la fille mal garde have already be not ( - see page 100 ) as well as that of lise churning and help she mother to spin . but the conventional gesture to spin ' have often be use in ballet .
fokine 's advice to that wish to create the romantic style of dance be much as fur demi - caractre when he say : the choreographer should base he design on classical technique from the foot to the waist , but above that the dancer 's head , body and arm must be free to express the mood , emotion and action of the character in the story or theme to be communicate . this style be first create by taglioni for he daughter marie . the tale of la sylphide give he an opportunity to exploit she expressive	arm	and face as well as she ability to dance sur le pointe . perrot develop the style in he dance fur carlotta grisi in giselle . it be then expand by fokine and use in both grave and gay mood in les sylphide and le carnaval , where it be particularly expressive of both meaning and music .
ondine , the sea nymph ( margot fonteyn ) so use she foot that she appeare always to float through water . this be do by a series of pa marchs each of which soft rise and fall through she foot from toe to heel . they be co - ordinate with a soft undulat movement of the	arm	. ashton thus create a special style fur a particular character which sum up as it be she whole being , but which would have be unsuitable for any other ballet . b once fokine have demonstrate that mim dance and dance mime be the good material to use in ballet where individual character have to stand out from the rest of the cast , and particularly when true love do not run smooth , other choreographer . follow suit .
he stand silent and still , watch the tragedy of the poor girl who be be reject by the rich man . he two tiny gesture say everything and express the audience 's understand of the plot . he make one as if he should try and comfort she , but turn away , walk upstage and on the balcony with he back to the audience , raise he	arm	widely only to drop they helpless . no one could fail to understand the onlooker 's reaction to the tale just unfold . to some extent the same idea of an onlooker apply to that of jaeger , the critic in enigma variation .
the latter 's vicious slap on the child 's face explain much than any other gesture natalia 's selfishness . yet the tutor 's capitulation to natalia reveal she power over every man she meet as well as he failure to withstand she wile . ashton 's careful build - up to this climax make vera 's discovery of they in each other 's	arm	all the very poignant because she show a child - like petulance at lose one she so long to have for she own . it be so unlike natalia 's reaction when find the tutor and vera together . the tutor remain a sympathetic character fur vera , s sorrow at he departure be echoe by kolia , natalia 's son , when he too realise he be lose the only person who have try to make he happy .
if choreographer study the above work of ashton and macmillan , they will understand how far the art of choreography have develop since fokine change it structure and texture . they will perhaps understand even good if they pay particular attention to the fine detail of every movement . it be no long the case that the romantic style mean dance classically from the foot to the waist and above that allow the body ,	arm	and head to express they to describe the mood , emotion and action of the character . it be well know that only a great dancer - artist can suggest the development of the sixteen - year - old aurora , happy at she birthday , into the dreamy figure the prince meet in the woodland glade and on to she final entrance as a triumphant princess fully awake to she responsibility as queen - to - be . the enchanement she dance thoughout the three scene do not change in style or content .
yet if the dance of vera and natalia in a month in the country and juliet in romeo and juliet be examine it will be discover how the technical content be so design that the step , pos and gesture show how change circumstance be affect the individual . this be what perrot first attempt with he five leitmotif for giselle ( see page 61 ) . continual development in the choreographic design be very obvious in the quiver of the raised leg as the tutor take natalia in he	arm	. it show she grow emotional involvement and gradually seem to affect she every movement . this same tiny movement also appear when vera begin to dance with the tutor , but she movement be not so intense .
juliet then become the slight apprehensive debutante at the ball where she movement , though tentative , be conventionally correct when she dance with paris . the moment she encounter romeo and sense somehow that she life have change she movement become very purposeful . from there onwards it become strong and very emotional so that she joyous movement and late abandon in romeo 's	arm	be in absolute contrast to she late dance with paris . she movements then be equally purposeful but they be constrict and withdraw , so that she father 's contemptuous rejection of she plea and he throw she to the floor seem the proper outcome of what in he eye be sheer disobedience . it be she final passionate abandon on discovere romeo 's body that demonstrate how overwhelm sorrow can destroy all sense of discipline over both body and mind .
in the same way as conventional gesture ( see page 88 ) , it have it rule which be formulate by john davie in orchestra , a poem of dancing ( 1594 ) . in it he discuss the motions seven that be in nature find ( stanza 73 ) . this rule give the direction into which the head , body and	arm	should move when express certain mood , emotion and action . 1 upward and outwards the head , body and arm rise upwards and outwards in all the happy emotion as can be see in the final dance of the sleep beauty , la fille mal garde and daphnis and chlo .
this rule give the direction into which the head , body and arm should move when express certain mood , emotion and action . 1 upward and outwards the head , body and	arm	rise upwards and outwards in all the happy emotion as can be see in the final dance of the sleep beauty , la fille mal garde and daphnis and chlo . if the movement only go upwards it usually means pride or arrogance . 2 downward and inward
the movements be very or less directe sideway , i.e . cart or effac , as in the dance fur romeo , mercutio and benvolio in romeo and juliet and fur the tutor in a month in the country . 4 sideway close ( crois ) if the character move sideway with the head , body and	arm	in some way avert from the front , i.e . crois , possibly with a twist of the shoulder , he or she be usually play some evil or cunning person . one of the fine example use to be de valois 's dance for the three comforter in job . they twist cunning movement be vividly contrast with that she create for elihu , the personification of youth and truth .
body should be fully stretch upwards and curve either slight forwards or backwards from the waist only . this stance must be accompany by the wellrecognised port de bra , which must be accurate co - ordinate with the footwork . the	arm	usually change after each brief enchanement . they movement also depend upon which foot be in front . if the right foot remain there for several bar , the arm will be hold still , but as soon as the left move in front the arm will change .
the arm usually change after each brief enchanement . they movement also depend upon which foot be in front . if the right foot remain there for several bar , the	arm	will change . there be also a tendency to pause in a pose at the end of a phrase and for a deliberate change to be make before further dance . an interesting point to note in real spanish folk dance be that the boy and girl rarely touch each other .
by so phrase each paragraph and bring each incident to a proper conclusion , nijinska give both dancer and audience time to consider what have be do and what be yet to happen . the nature of the formal shape make by the dancer 's body and limb as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluate . nijinska insist on the use of the pointe in order to emphasise the elongate portrait of the byzantine saint , thus the dancer 's body mostly face the audience but they	arm	and leg turn inwards and be see mostly in profile . the angle make at the elbow , shoulder , knee and ankle joint be clearly visible . that of the arm be particularly intereste because the fist be either clench or the finger flatten thus the line and shape make only appear slight round by the fold in the sleeve .
technical characteristics it be the very particular choreographic style that macmillan create for the child - like figure in requiem that emphasise very strongly than any other of today 's ballet the need for choreographer to explore dance it . only when they have examine what hand ,	arm	, leg and foot , body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story , theme or music , can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture , with the right quality , mood , emotion , action and character . the structure will determine the line and shape need to fill the dimension and , when need , help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole . schoreographe must then decide how many and which detail they need to add to disclose the particular feature of the story , theme and/or music that they wish to communicate .

one could argue that digital technology be not the only way to solve a particular circuit problem ; a nifty bit of design work with a couple of op - amps plus a few r and c can replace a complex digital filter system . furthermore , it can be do in a language with which many ew + ww reader will be totally familiar . however , the same little collection of component would not allow a robot	arm	to be place reliable alongside an item on a conveyor belt . and if the robot control function require a signal filter , it would seem sensible to incorporate the filter block as part of the dsp recognition software rather than reach for discrete analogue component . the same argument for use of digital electronics apply equally to communication system , test and measurement , broadcast and consum electronics .
for many circuit , practical value will need to be derive by scaling : but be cautious about accuracy . there be no problem with comparator f from voltage reference . but in many circuit , significant source and load resistance will need factor out from the upper and low	arm	value respective ( and scale pro - rata ) , otherwise the implied accuracy will be false ) . also round error can affect case where extreme accuracy be require . it also perform wye - delta transformation ( handy for network analysis simplification ) and define multi - tap divider , for up to ten output voltage .

virgin last night refuse to commend , but estimate be that the deal could be worth well in excess of 50m , make it one of the large investments by a japanese organisation in a uk company . with a turnover of about 250m , virgin records be one of the few independent leave in the music business . in august the virgin group sell it film and video distribution	arm	, virgin vision , to managemend company entertainment in the us . but in spite of clear signal from virgin records that it want to remain independent , speculation be rife that the purchaser might be sony . industry observer fear that this would be another nail in the coffin of the independent record industry .

if the goddess of democracy symbolise a vision of china alien to the communist party , the new figure be equally alien to the student : the obedience of the intellectual and unflinch solidarity of the worker , peasant and soldier . ironically , neither of this vision be chinese . while the student look to the west , china 's hardline leadership have find it inspiration in the pre - glasnose soviet union of stalinist aesthetics - muscular	arm	, square jaw and stiff pos . the official blurb explain that the plaster figure stand as if boldly for ahead , they eye fix on we motherland 's beautiful future . perhaps unwittingly , the new statue hint at a deep truth underpinn the hardline triumph : the worker , the peasant and the intellectual gaze wistfully towards the forbidden city , the grand monument to the genius of chinis civilisation , but the soldier have he eye fix in a different direction down the avenue of eternal peace towards zhongnanhai , the wall compound where party leader live and work .
a soviet deputy defence minister , general varrenikov , have be in addis ababa for the past week . he be report to be negotiat the complete withdrawal of the 1,500 soviet military adviser . the russian have say they believe in a negotiated settlement to the civil war , but they be continue to supply	arm	to president mengistu , apparently to allow he to negotiate from a position of strength . a large consignment of weapon be unload from a soviet ship at assab on 21 september . weapon will not , however , save president mengistu if no one be willing to use they .
the price tag of almost 100m , and the fact that fuji have agreed to a minority stake , have clearly also provide mr branson with reassurance if he need any that take virgin private last year be the right thing to do . virgin pay 248m last year to remove the group from the scrutiny of the city , say the business be misunderstood and the stock undervalue . less than a year late , fuji seem very than will to pay 100m for a minority share in the music	arm	which , with sale of 260m , represents much little than half of the virgin empire . what remain a mystery be how virgin would have far have it director decide to weather the storm in the stock market . the recent spate of takeover in the record industry have obliterate the independents and leave the big five of sony , thorn em i , bertelsman , warner and polygram with 70 per cent of the market .
an east german unwisely , perhaps , in view of the easy access through the front door make a desperate bid to scramble over the embassy railing . when he be half - way over , the czechoslovak police guard the back of the embassy grab the man 's belt and begin haule he down . alert to the scuffle , east german inside the building seize he	arm	and leg . as much east german join the cry for help , the diplomat burst through the front door and sprint 300 yard around the embassy perimeter until he reach the grotesque tug - of - war . he leap into the tussle and embrace the man from behind .

it would require patience and a labour government would have to continue to meet it obligation to nato , to service personnel and to worker in the defence industry . much of all we cannot renege on we responsibility to we own people , mr o 'neill say . a labour government would immediately initiate the wide possible review defence commitment world - wide and set up an	arm	conversion agency . tony benn , who mr o 'neill recall be a member of a labour cabinet commit to nuclear defence , insist that britain do not need nuclear weapon because there be no soviet threat . every labour mp be elect two year ago on a pledge to ry britain of nuclear weapon .

the former k condemn the kabul regime with the same tone he use when the soviet troop be in afghanistan and have also refuse to endorse the mujahedin interim government in peshawar . president najibullah have be hel since the soviet withdrawal by a a revival of afghan nationalism , which he government have cleverly exploit to present the mujahedin as foreign - back invader . he government have have considerable success in winning over guerrilla field commander and turn they into semi - autonomous militias with lavish handout of money and	arm	. the secret of we success lie in this militias , say president najibullah . morale be high , especially after the mujahedin fail to capture jalalabad as they say they would .
and if there be still no president when the current assemb session expire in december 1990 , the very mechanism that be intended to ensure the continuation of the lebanese state will cease to exist . the unhappy truth be that foreign army have be marche backwards and forwards across lebanon for hundred of year . weapon have flood into the country since the 1860 when the royal navy deliver	arm	to the druze . syria be still supplie guns to the muslims , just as iraq be supply gun to the christian . it be the task of lakhdar ibrahimi , the arab league envoy , to struggle through a tangle of sub - issue in the hope that he can persuade the lebanese to renegotiate france 's political legacy and the policy that begin when general henri gouraud , who become the french high commissioner of lebanon in 1920 , step ashore .
and , as mao 's reputation slip , so too do chen 's . in 1966 , however , when mao begin he dramatic bid for absolute power , use young red guard to discredit and persecute he old rival within the party , chen again rise to the occasion , act as a mouthpiece for mao 's increasingly scramble thought and policy . chen be even say to have write , or at little supervise at mao 's behest , the cultural revolution 's good - known tract an hysterical call to	arm	against counter - revolutionary print in the people 's daily in april 1966 under the title sweep away all ghost and monster . to carry out a wholesale purge of the party apparatus , mao appoint chen as head of the cultural revolution group , a kitchen cabinet of loyal disciple , include mao 's wife jiang qing , that be to lead the assault on the party hierarchy . the group be final disband in 1969 , by which time china have be plunge into virtual anarchy and economic collapse .

war in henry v be a test of kingship rather than a subject in it own right . henry 's achievement in the play be not military as such , but rhetorical . he do not prive by feat of	arm	, but by word , that he be not any very the dissipate boy that he be ; but that be enough . he find a way of talk about england , about right , about courage as a sort of secular sainthood , and it be he word , act on he army , that bring france down . the french messenger mountjoy , bring an insult from the dauphin , be meet with a fierce defiance that leave he , in this version , visible shock .

if mr gorbachev believe he could acquire a breath space through repression , during which the economy could be transform by unpopular but necessary reforms , he might be will to pay the price , but this would reverse he strategy of the past three year . in this period he come to believe that , to be effective , economic reforms must be accompany by political liberalisation . to crush strike and abandon political reform would be to throw he into the	arm	of that group wedd not just to authoritarian politics but to neo - stalinist economic institution and principle . at which point mr gorbachev 's strategy of turn the ussr into a prosperous society in which intelligent russian can take pride will be doom . in a capitalist country , political dictatorship be not incompatible with economic modernisation and can even facilitate it .

the army order sentry to wear flak jacket and construct many sandbag emplacement , although many barrack be still protect by little much than chain link fence . the ira do not choose to attack again until march 1987 . a possible reason be that it be difficult to get	arm	and ammunition to the right place , despite the virtual absence of border control between germany and it western neighbour . communication with an active service unit two to 10 terrorist far from ireland be a further obstacle . another reason could be that the ira have become aware of british intelligence 's drive for informer .

with respect to the latter , for example , woman be no long exclude from night duty and they perform a wide range of section duty than before . however , ordinary policewoman tend to feel that there be constraint upon equal opportunity within the force . some of this be official , in that senior manager do not allow policewoman to carry	arm	, from which follow some restriction on where policewoman cbe be statione , and on they involvement in high - profile political policing , such as at riot . much of the constraint , however , be informal . with relatively so few policewoman , the occupational culture of the force be heavily masculine , and the wide cultural value that exist in northern ireland general make man very conservative in they attitude towards gender and sex role .
it be a desperate way to look at it but when you go out there be 16 soldier to every 2 policeman and you work out the odd , and that be 8 to 1 against you be hit . it be awful , but that be the way you mind works like , i know guy who lose	arm	and leg see , now i deliberately sit , when i be out in a land rover , with one arm up a bit high than the other and one leg a bit higher . like , i suppose that way if i be hit i might stand a chance of only lose one arm or one leg .

like , i know guy who lose arm and leg see , now i deliberately sit , when i be out in a land rover , with one arm up a bit high than the other and one leg a bit higher . like , i suppose that way if i be hit i might stand a chance of only lose one	arm	or one leg . ( fn 15/5/1987 , p 1516 ) as intimate , the danger of attack means that two neighbourhood man walk they beat be accompany by at little sixteen soldier , sometimes also by another squad of soldier provide cover for that who be protect the police , by two or very land rover from the british army and the ruc , and an army helicopter .
i lie there for what seem like an eternity and feel in a sort of panic . be i wounde had i lose an	arm	or leg i be now able to breathe properly and start to feel over i body with both hand . i be all right .
as i enter the barn someone hand i a mess - tin full of hot tea . i sit down on the straw and look around . a few foot away two medics be lie stretch out on the floor of the barn , one lie face down , he	arm	by he side , he appear to be dead . no , they be not dead , piper . the poor bastard be exhaust !
as i lie in the ditch i be sudden conscious of a very strong indescribable sickly smell . raise i on one hand to peer over the ditch before clamber out onto the road , i hand and forearm sudden go through the soft earth up to the elbow . as i pull i	arm	cover with a green and black substance . i feel a strong feeling of nausea as i realise that i have put i hand through the chest of a dead british soldier that could have be lie in the ditch for several day . the body have be cover by a thin layer of soil as be the practice when a soldier be kill in action and there be no time to move he to the rear .
a famous passage of art criticism can be cit as one example entire beyond dispute . the author spend much of he life as a bachelor fellow of brasenose college oxford ; he cloister life be devote to write , notable on classical antiquity and the italian renaissance . walter pater be a master of	atmosphere	; he have be inspire as a young man by ruskin , and he idealism about art and he fine prose be in turn much admire by a young generation of aesthete , among who oscar wilde be a prominent figure . one of pater 's subject for a perceptive essay be leonardo da vinci ; it give special prominence to the paint now generally know as the mona lisa . the follow critical passage come from this piece , first publish in the fortnightly review in 1869 , and then in 1873 in pater 's book , study in the history of the renaissance .
they be capable of assesse modern art in it own term , partly from experience gain through judge work of other period within quite different term . meyer schapiro , who have a specialist concern with romanesque art , be an open - minded historian of this sort . he wrote enthusiastically about the late work of arshile gorky : gorky be	atmosphere	, veile the hard opaque wall of the canvas , evoke a nocturnal void or the vague , unstable image - space of the day - dreame mind . and he remember the painter : i use to meet he much often in the museum and gallery fix in rapt contemplation of picture with that grave , searching look which be one of the beauty of he face .
for example , this be how he evoke seurat 's scene of the parisian suburban resort know as la grande jatte . beneath a sultry sky , at four o'clock , the island , boat slip past it flank , stir with a casual sunday crowd enjoy the fresh air among the tree ; and this forty or so figure be endow with a succinct , hieratic line the	atmosphere	be transparent and uncommonly vibrant ; the surface seem to flicker or glimmer . fnon , like other excellent critic , be a valued friend of artist , and so he remain all he life even though he give up write criticism after a decade of work on the revue blanche from 1893 to 1903 . he accept a position in a dealer 's gallery , where matisse be among the artist who benefit from he judgement .
theatre invite you to give you full attention to what be happen on stage the theatrical experience be a very concentrate one and you as a member of the audience be vitally connect to what be go on . as part of the audience you be as much a part of the entertainment as the performance it , and this be something that dramatist be aware of and have always write for . sometimes you will be directly address by the character this be something which happen a great deal in greek and elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by chorus in act 4 , scene 1 of henry v , which draw the audience into the	atmosphere	before a battle enormous effective ) . it be also use as a dramatic device by many contemporary playwright . the film be a very distinct dramatic medium .
the heart of england trip . get in touch with the true essence of england , what it be to be english . let the village	atmosphere	seep into you pore . see if you can make contact with it , this magical thing call englishness . i want to see if i could experience it .
since 1980 professional training course have proliferate and many can be find in and around london . all of they take the working actor 's problem into account and attempt to create classes which can make free hour both discipline and profitable . the actor ' centre in covent garden have function since 1980 , and offer a variety of professional classes in a relax	atmosphere	. it also cater for that who want very intensive session . for movement and dance , the pineapple studio in the same part of town seem to be one of the good there be , though it be not intended primarily for dancer and actor people from all sort of profession come along to keep fit .
perhaps director in particular need to realise how much they vitality mean to the continuing performance that it be not enough to be leave up on a stage mere do it night after night . a.r. be that somethe that you feel may come from the hothouse	atmosphere	of drama school in the first place p.r maybe it do .
in fact , whereas the parallel protestant movement of evangelical revival be for all people , and the issue tend to be decisive , catholic spirituality diverge on both point . the principal one be that conversion and growth be particularly directe at the clerical - religious lite , where the annual retreat system form the annual or biennial centre of the individual spiritual life . the retreat consist , and still do , of anything from five to thirty day of spiritual exercise , usually in an	atmosphere	of silence and contemplation apart from listen to the preach when there be one , but with additional feature of both vocal and silent prayer . the laity have a pale reflection of this programme in the parish mission , design to convert the laity or at little bring they back to regular church practice . morality be for the laity , who life be dominate by the battle against mortal sin , and who therefore live under the threat of hell and be always at risk .
well never enter a church , he wrote , than enter in a spirit of false awe . churche and art gallery , he wrote . that funereal	atmosphere	. false awe in the face of death , he wrote . no one know how to react , all speak in low tone with solemn face .
the pressure to remodel old pub be of course nothing new . the victorian and edwardian era witness many wholesale rebuilding of modest georgian drink - house ; during the interwar period even much money be pump into enlarge and rebuild old pub , as well as in create large new one ( see alan power 's essay below ) . however , alteration be very often than not effecte with some degree of sympathy for the exist fabric and	atmosphere	. with the advent of postwar modernism much of this sympathy evaporate . the ascetic modernist 's rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave new world be clearly incompatible with the historic pub .
the ascetic modernist 's rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave new world be clearly incompatible with the historic pub . this attitude be amply reveal in the result of the competition ( inside the pub ) launch jointly by the architectural review and the brewer 's society in 1949 . in october of that year the ar regret that nearly all competition entry have evade the key problem and have signally fail to achieve the genuine pub	atmosphere	. contemporary design , the magazine 's editor regret , because it have no root in the vernacular idiom will not appear immediately familiar , whilst the mock - tudor and the mock - georgian style which have be so prevalent no matter how misguide in they have spring from a genuine attempt to preserve a traditional atmosphere . as pub designer tim may not in he address to camra 's agm of 1990 : by any objective standard , the competition be a disaster .

a pub , like any other old building , be far much than just it principle facade , or it four wall . as neil richardson note in 1980 , an old town pub be not just an attractive victorian or georgian facade , it be a building which be still be use for the purpose for which it be build . the design of interior be as valid today as they be in early time the vault , snug , parlour , each with they own character , can still provide a pleasant , vary	atmosphere	. however , to public and professional alike many old building be still regarde as represent little much than four external wall . this even apply to list building : there be still a worryingly widespread general belief that list only cover the facade , or perhaps just the exterior , whereas it be of course express design to protect the whole building .
this be especially true of that pub now target by the brewery as centre for family eat . a traditional interior do not have to be incompatible with accommodat whole family , nor with provid meal ; yet an increase number of old pub interior be be sacrifice on the altar of the identikit eat house whether the brewer 's concept be a downmarket steakhouse or part of a family restaurant chain masquerad as an independent local concern . many of the interior create by the designer of such facility be as forbidd as the old - fashioned spit - and - sawdust pub ; any linger	atmosphere	be sweep away in a barrage of stained wood and fake victoriana , and any casual visitor make to feel inordinately guilty if they do not , alas , wish to eat . the subjugation of individual character in such case which on occasion even involve the removal of all trac of the pub 's actual name be particularly depresse . the aim of this report be not to demand that brewer turn the block back to 1620 , 1720 , 1820 or even to 1920 ; pubs have to make money , and have to adap to some extent to change need and expectation .
much need to be do . the multi - room and historical - eclectic pub need to be protect against the ravage of the all - over designer look . as have be frequently point out , it be no use provide excellent beer or food if the pub in question have lose all of it charm and	atmosphere	; and sure a multi - room pub , with a number of differ environments , be the good way to serve what be after all alway a very diverse and unstandardised community . in 1976 the lord chief justice , dismisse bass charrington 's appeal against a proposal to open up the interior at the roman hotel in southwick , sussex , declare that it might be undesirable in the public interest to see much public bar disappear and much merger of public and saloon bar of the kind in question here in addition , far good liaison need to be establish between the brewery and local authority conservation and plan officer , english heritage , the national amenity societies , local civic body and , of course , pub landlord and they clientele over plan pub refurbishment .
the birmingham international film and television festival enter it seven year in 1991 acknowledged as an event of national and international importance . the festival also play a role in the artistic renaissance of birmingham , a profile confirm by the continuing success of the city of birmingham symphony orchestra , under it artistic director , simon rattle , the recent move of both the birmingham royal ballet ( former sadler 's wells royal ballet ) and the d'oyly carte opera company to birmingham , the newly launch towards the millennium annual art festival and the art council of great britain 's invitation to birminghbe to launch art 2000 , as the uk city of music in 1992 . the film and television industry be important ingredient of the city 's culture and the festival reflect this life - style in it informal	atmosphere	, give endless pleasure to the many cinema goer from the city and to the numerous professional who visit the city for the festival . i wish the festival success for 1991 . councillor bryan bird chairman , leisure service committee
at the first hotel i work in , i have share an office , with one other cleaner a taciturn alcoholic who teach i how to keep i head down but in i new job , there be five of we who share the same poky little room . consequently , first thing in the morning when we be all try to get ready , we constant get in each other 's way . the	atmosphere	be , however , cordial , if not convivial , and the talk be of what grandchild be up to or what dr so - and - so say about this or that particular problem . shortly after i arrive , there arise a new topic for conversation . there have be a rash of petty theft in the hotel and we be all warn to be vigilant .
we end up trade memory of paris in the fifty and england before the war . the young man who make the tea sit with we , occasionally contribute to the conversation . the	atmosphere	be warm and peaceful . much people arrive : much experience be share . storie of a bitter world , tell without bitterness or self - pity .
how be everyone , in spite of thing oh , fine . the	atmosphere	be a bit tense , understandable listen , what can i do for you i need some idea , charle . i have a young friend in she early twenty who want to do some a - level at a reasonable nightschool in london .
nice to meet you , jay . he lop upstairs . the	atmosphere	have hold a certain smoky glow , he have fragment it . so sure of he , so sure of lucy . what be he do this day ask jay .
you be expect to take adequate step to protect you . in this example , the opponent have throw he forwards , with no think of a face guard it go almost without say that karate competition must be hold in an	atmosphere	of respect , for the self , for the opponent and for the member of the referee panel . where this be miss , the penalty can be severe in the extreme . not only must the contestant behave , but they team - mate be also oblige to conduct they properly , even when not fighte .
train to conclude this section it be necessary to point out a few thing about the squad training session . firstly , karateka be not allow to bring they own coach with they to train session because experience have show that the presence of other coach break up the training	atmosphere	, and cause people to eseparat to far corner instead of remain together . the second point be that you may be ask to take a drug test at any squad session . if you refuse , you will be treat as though you have fail the test , and you will face a lifetime ban .
he go out and robertson hear the hoove of he garron clopp on the road . he get up and dress as though in a trance , and set off for the castle with the hangdog look of a condemned man . in the smithy house at dull , jean bruce hail lain silent under the cover until she four little sister and brother have stop fidget in the oppressive	atmosphere	and she parent have start to snore . when she hear the shrill call , like an owl but human , she slip out and join she lover in the little barn beside the byre . she and donald have start to take risk they want each other so much that the reality of other people have dimm for they , half the time they feel cloak in invisibility .
the word draw on he memory of a secret meet he have go to at the end of he first year in glasgow . it have look like a melodrama a little group in a candle - light attic , hold up they arm with fist clench and swear to do or die . but they have mean it , and he be eager now to bring everybody together in a fine , hard point of resolve , in case zeal slacken and dy away in the holiday	atmosphere	of this soft , comfortable afternoon . the hills they look asleep , the heather glowe dust - blue in the hazy light , and the people , after a night of little sleep and hour of walk and stand , now look stun as they sit on the grassy bank , lean on dyke , or lie on they back in the hayfield , munch oatcake and drink the last of they water . some little group be go off to west and east , but much hang on with a sense that the next thing now demande to be do .
significantly he add : but there be also exultation , the fascination as well as the fear of great strength . in such comment we find we in the precise	atmosphere	of rudolf otto be numinous , the mysterium tremendum et fascinan the mystery that create wonderment as well as terror which sure accounts at little in part for the high level of religious feeling in canadian folklore and literature ; not little in leonard 's expression of it . it also account for poetry be a much natural instrument of it literary expression than fiction or drama . he frugality extend to he two work - place .
nor be you please . you be surprise that the council could not do very for the world . but you be cautiously optimistic because of the constructive	atmosphere	in which the talk take place . you be hopeful of good result at future meeting . after the dinner , each of the head of state be to be present with a small luctian art form .
library footage , say trevor , of a refinery on trame . refin red iron be pump into the breath apparatus that each inhabitant of trame wear at all time . with the help of the red iron a traman be able to inhale the	atmosphere	of the planet which would otherwise be dead to he and to exhale ga for export to vascar . the vascar have , of course , become headless through repeate exposure to tramen - exhalation . but the ga also caus they to grow extra arm and leg ( at a rate for the average adult male vascar of one limb every two month , slight long for woman and child ) .
i be not please . i be surprise that the council could not do very for the world . but i be cautiously optimistic about the	atmosphere	in which the talk be conduct . i be hopeful for good result at future council . i be lonely yes , but i loneliness be the price i pay in order that the people of the world may look ahead to peace and freedom and to a decent standard of live for they child .
but the present doctrine of competition be destroy it , and with it the picture of we englishness . children be mostly friendly , only accidentally cruel . but soon enough they learn competition , useful at first , but dangerous when it become , as it easy do , the only	atmosphere	. not his need be great than i . not grace darling .
it truly be a much remarkable week . the field of player , and the facility they enjoy , be far superior to some tournament on the world tou offer much very prize money . the	atmosphere	remain that of a small - town challenger event , relax , friendly and informal , the perfect place to escape to after the tension and crowd of the french open . jokes pour forth from the pa system , and so do hit from the 50 's and 60 's . it just be not like that anywhere else .
for every four window on a mark 3 standard - class coach there be four and a hf bay of seat , only the end bay match the window and succeed bay be very tightly spac so that some passenger be seat against a blank wall . but in rid , quietness , and general environment , mark 3 coach glide through the countryside at speed owe little to even a decade ago . ~_~wall - to - wall carpet , luggage racks run lengthways above the window , supplement by space for cas and bag between the seat , provide an unclutter spaciousness to give a relax	atmosphere	on the longest of journey . at little that be what it should be like . the upsurge in traffic in the 1980 have ala mean that passenger have often have to stand in the centre aisle , in the lobby , and around the door vestibule .
but this will be to no avail if the choreographer be attempt to tell a story and do not have expert advice from musician of the calibre of edwin evan , constant lambert and john lanchbery . all make valuable score from exist music for de valois , ashton and macmillan . not all the result be of the same high quality ; nevertheless the music they arrange reinforce the choreographer 's design by give the plot	atmosphere	, local colour , continuity and flow as well as give the dance it rhythmic vitality , emotion and mood . in some cas it also hel to underline the main moment in the action by emphasise gesture for great strength and expression . in other cas they add humou , much notable in lanchbery 's score for la fille mal garde , where several witty slant in the orchestration raise laughter , for example the music for the cock and the hen .
it be in contrast to another leitmotif that mark the entrance of carabosse , the wick fairy . the two tune underline the conflict between good and evil . whereas adam and prokofiev 's leitmotif height the emotional content of the love theme , tchaikovsky 's be there to create the right	atmosphere	and to emphasise the conflict . when stravinsky compose the firebird he use leitmotif in yet another way . he create very distinctive passage of ascend chord to accompany the magic bird 's flight through the tree .
manner of move the body as in walk , run , dance , etc . if choreographer be to justify they reason for create a ballet , they should use or create a style of movement appropriate to and expressive of the character in the story be tell and they mood , emotion and action . the dancer or player in a theme ballet will need to convey the general	atmosphere	and any other element pertinent to the situation in which they find they , as well as the mood and content of the music choose to give they phras . they will need to do the same if they be interpre music . today there be many ballet which be create in the generally accept style from which choreographer can borrow : classical , demi - caractre , romantic , character and/or national , and modern ( see page 75138 ) .
( see also page 41 . ) rhythm in ballet be not therefore a mere time - keeper as it be in such social ballroom dance as waltze and fox - trot . a ballet fur the stage must have an overall rhythm which set the	atmosphere	, quality , mood and possibly the emotional content of the whole . and ballet must also have short phrase rhythm which will give it variety , dimension , mass , structure , texture and style . perhaps no ballet have ever make the same impact on dancer and audience as stravinsky 's rite of spring .
3 once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have be decide , they should be discuss with the composer or arranger of music who first task may be to create a proper begin with the overture . be it to set the general	atmosphere	and mand as stravinsky do for the firebird mysterious sound of the wind whisper in the tree , the soar flight of a bird and the heavy tread of an unseen foot be still a wonderful introduction to this magic tale . on the other hand , prokofiev use he overture to romeo and juliet to introduce the leitmotif which will help both dancer and audience to follow the unfolding of the plot . he contrast the love theme of romeo and juliet with that which accompany the bitter struggle and fight between montague and capulet .
despite the general activitie there be menace in the air and it be not long before the rival faction of montagues and capulets be fight and deaths occurre before the lover even meet . this opening be very different from the quietly charm first scene of a month in the country , where the only thing amiss be natalia 's bore behaviou . even with such example in mind the choreographer may well decide it be good to delay the confrontation between the chief player because , by create and stresse the general	atmosphere	, this raise the audience 's expectation before the meet of the protagonist , and the sudden onset of passion be what make the ultimate tragedy so poignant . this happen in giselle where hilarion 's suspicion of albrecht 's identity be already arouse before albrecht meet giselle . hilarion 's discovery of albrecht 's sword and late he confrontation with giselle , with the sword in he hand , still do not convince giselle of albrecht 's duplicity .
the secular , moral and emotional behaviour of character find in rural or urban community ; secondly the traditional dance and customs of a particular country that can give local colour and	atmosphere	to a plot or theme ; thirdly gesture and behaviour from work activitie in rural area ( landowner , farmer and peasant ) or in urban area ( merchant , innkeeper and so on ) or from the profession ( army , navy , medicine , law ) .
they be also part of certain style of indian dance where gesture be explicit in convey the beauty of the world , of woman and of - love . in such dance physical contact between lover rare if ever take place . ashton break this all - but - write law and communicate the exotic	atmosphere	of the dream but there be little to express the passion of love , which he would late convey in such work as a month in the country . chinis the much interesting of present - day ballet inspire by oriental source be macmillan 's song of the earth ( music by mahler ) .
even such mundane task as eat or drink have find a place in some ballet . because on the stage they acquire importance , they must be see to have a proper purpose . this be usually to throw light on the character be play or to create the right	atmosphere	for the location of the action and for the expressive action require for the unfolding of the plot or theme . the concert robbin 's view of concert - goer . the listener ( the royal ballet )
the events and circumstance surround such plot be difficult to control and organise because the character be supposed live in the real world . so the choreographer cannot make strong contrast between the style usually use for the other - worldly spirit and that use for the character live in the particular setting . he can only highlight the	atmosphere	support the plot , especially tho circumstance where he have to portray difference between classes and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasy , etc . , for example the contrast that must be make between the dance for all and sundry in the town square and that for the aristocrat in the ballroom of romeo and juliet . nevertheless every choreographer create this kind of romantic ballet today have to spend much time create the proper gesture to replace the word , which in such ballet be never speak but must be understand . if the dancer perform that gesture with feel and understand they will express the mood , emotion and action of the character they play .
if the dancer perform that gesture with feel and understand they will express the mood , emotion and action of the character they play . this be what happen in macmillan 's romeo and juliet and ashton 's a month in the country . it be perhaps appropriate to stress again that where playwright require page of dialogue to explain every factor in the development of the plot , to create a change	atmosphere	and to show how the action affect the actor in the play , dancer can communicate whole passage of dialogue in a few expressive gesture wove into enchanement . ( as play by the moscow art theatre , turgenev 's a month in the country take over two hour , ashton 's ballet rough half an hour . ) only character and episode essential to the plot be retain .
massine 's brilliant use of descriptive and narrative gesture in the three - cornered hat be a proper development of fokine 's mim dance and dance mime , first see in the firebird and petrushka . as already note , the dance fokine stage for the nursemaid , coachman and other at the fair be real dance ( see page 59 ) . they create the	atmosphere	and mood , but the narrative be tell by the doll use special create movement which could be call dance of character . character from the commedium dell'arte when dauberval define what he mean by dance of character he undoubted have in mind some easily recognised character of the commedium dell'arte , who actor regularly play such role as the absent - minded doctor or scientist , miser , termagant wife or widow and various clown such as the sad pierrot or zany clown .
yet this work be absolutely contemporary when produce . the three boy come directly from a battleship when they pick up three girl from the street . the dancing reflect the wartime	atmosphere	when shore leave be a cherish moment . even though the boy and girl be figment of robbin 's imagination , they brief encounter be base in reality even to the introduction of popular dance step and stylistic element current during the 193945 war . both the above - mention works show that ballet base on the life of real people require that choreographer closely observe the characteristics and idiosyncrasy of all type of person and that they make they recognisable in order that they convey mean .
the group activitie ensure that each phase of the ceremony be perform according to tradition . the design emphasise the importance of create a style which will define not only the time , place and action , but also the character portray . the technical or general style create the structure and	atmosphere	of the whole . in other word , the particular become the general . a similar analysis could be make of macmillan 's requiem .
it be the very particular choreographic style that macmillan create for the child - like figure in requiem that emphasise very strongly than any other of today 's ballet the need for choreographer to explore dance it . only when they have examine what hand , arm , leg and foot , body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story , theme or music , can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture , with the right quality , mood , emotion , action and character . the structure will determine the line and shape need to fill the dimension and , when need , help to create the	atmosphere	and mood of the whole . schoreographe must then decide how many and which detail they need to add to disclose the particular feature of the story , theme and/or music that they wish to communicate . the exploration of what each part of the body can express in isolation and then in co - ordination with the rest be possibly the much important aspect of a choreographer 's work if it seek to be modern in spirit and technique .
while we must support family room in that pub which have the space and can provide suitable amusement for the little angel , this cannot remain the only answer to the problem . family room be useful to let the less well - behave and noisy child run riot but they be frequently cold and characterless and , no matter how good the facility may be , you often feel exclude from the main atmosphere of the pub . i would rather take i child into the main bar or lounge of a pub and expect they to sit sensible and reasonable quietly so that we can all relax , drink , talk and eat in a proper pub	atmosphere	. what be need be a relaxation of the law as it now stand to allow the control admission of child to certain pub at certain time of day . i be not propose a free - for - all , but the admission of child to certain pub on the application of the licensee and the approval of the local license bench .
no they secret be first reveal to curious scientific man , to apothecary and simple - collector , to people who could now be call botanist , and such be evan robert . have you ever be up to clogwyn du 'r arddu in the pour rain and the vilest weather it	atmosphere	at that time be utterly special . the troll and gargoyl buttress wheel around you through rift in the cloud ; they stretch , soar , disappear , solidify again sudden out of the vapour then drift impossibly far up into the mist until you sense reel at the evanescent dynamism of the scene . the only climber i know who go there regularly at time like this be that perverse little bugger joe brown , who be clearly captivate by the magic of the place , though he will never let you know as much in word .

but no art , major or minor , can be govern by the rule of social amenity . the english have a great talent than any other people for create an agreeable family life ; that be why it be such a threat to they artistic and intellectual life . if the	atmosphere	be not so charm , it would be less of a temptation . in postwar britain , the clothes , accents , and diction of the sibling may have change , but , so far as i can judge , the suffocat insular coziness be just the same . here , as often with the author of thankyou , fog , we may well suspect that auden generalize about english life too much on the basis of he own late - edwardian childhood in a comfortable rentier household .
not a mad promise menu , and fratch with predictable danger . compare with the mystery surround the deaths of president kennedy or marilyn monroe , the controversy surround spandau 's 93 - year - old inmate be about as interesting as the fall of a dead leaf . and disperse the audience 's attention among nine separate tv set be a sure way of disperse any	atmosphere	you may have be lucky enough to set up . in the event 90 minute without an interval it quickly become clear that all the surveillance in the house would be cruelly traine on that unfortunate doom to flesh out brenton 's thought . the plot , insofar as one could discern it , be both labyrinthine and self - cancellingly ambiguous , buil round an interview in a psychiatric hospital between a journalist and the grief - obsess widow of a german professor who have bequeath a videotape cast doubt on the official version of hess 's death .

this can lead to judgement be make about the unsuccessful , the unemployed , the poor and the unintelligent which be both uncharitable and untrue . i be think of the sort of attitude that suggest the unemployed do too little to help they , that if only you have determination and drive you can get on in the world . he say there be positive factor in the new	atmosphere	between local authority and private enterprise , but it hardly touch on the problem of poor housing , lack of amenity and the continuing unemployment . this problem be what lead to that sense of be leave out , of isolation and despair , which in turn can lead to the symptoms we be familiar with drug and alcohol abuse , crime and vandalism , debt and family break - up . a down street spokesman say yesterday that there be absolutely no reaction at all to dr runcie 's late broadside .

but it be sure silly to deny that it have thrown politician and television journalist together in an association that remain totally invisible to the public . in fact , thank large to sir robin day the grand inquisitor , as he call he in the title of he new book the impression that the average view probably have of politics on television be that it be predominantly adversarial . that may still be true of the set - piece studio interview though even there the prior indication of line of questioning be by no means unknown ( and the viewer would probably be astonish at the general closeness of the	atmosphere	that prevail in the green room afterwards ) . of course , television be a perform trade and the very element of show business involve for both the interrogator and the victim be bind to have it effect on what lord beaverbrook use to proclaim as the armed frontier between politics and journalism . like a lot of lord beaverbrook 's phras , that be probably very colourful than accurate but if such a frontier ever exist then the imperative of current affair television have certainly modifie and adjust it .

what much strike you about this elegantly swaddled creature be that she seem encumber by the costume of she role . likewise , aesthetically lacquer trapping dramatically impede the movements of the drama 's main character . take two contrast storie of thwart aspiration from chikamatsu , akimoto 's play juxtapose to evoke the	atmosphere	of popular melodrama - high - flown sentiment and down - to - earth sense . while one tale be all doom romantic passion , the other portray an unglamorous urge to stay alive . the heroic plot have chubei , an ardent , sensitive youth , fall in love with umegawa , a courtesan chance bring he way .
and it will not , he tell the conference . nuclear power be , without a doubt , the clean and by any objective criterium safest way of sustain growth and protectingthe environment at the same time . it be the only energy available in the quantity we need that do not damage we	atmosphere	. and it be also the only source of power we know that will still be available when coal and ga supply run out . several delegate express disappointment at the delay in the electricity privatisation timetable , but mr wakeham say he would make no apology .

it also have something to do , i be sorry to say , with intellectual laziness . if something or somebody seem to be all the go , it take a determined editor to ignore it even if he think it wildly over - rate . the incestuous	atmosphere	of medium discourse be exacerbate too by british xenophobium . a ( probably correct ) belief that anything foreign will be regard as either irrelevant or incomprehensible tend to reinforce parochial cross - fertilisation . what have become apparent be that the hype chorus have become counter - productive by it very volume .

the superficial similarity might make a less man than mikhail gorbachev tremble . take , for example , an article this week in the ogonyok magazine by alexei adzhubey . a former editor of izvestia , who be at the central committee plenum of 1964 which accept the resignation of he father - in - law on the ground of age and health , mr adzhubey be perfect place to recall the stifl	atmosphere	in the politburo court at the time . then as now , he say , basic good sudden disappear from the shop . this artificial deficit vanish almost as soon as khrushchev have depart .
but despite it bland style , it hide a time bomb for britain , for the report be on southern africa . british officials say they believe this conference will not be obsess with south africa , as previous meeting have be . the election of fw de klerk as president be a sign of progress , they say , and the imminent release of walter sisulu and the apparent movement toward negotiation be sign of a new	atmosphere	. britain want to encourage movement , not to stifle it , and any talk of sanction would be bind to have a bad effect . yet even the british acknowledge that there be individual and country wedd to sanction , and accorde to commonwealth official , britain may well again find it in a minority of one when the subject be debate .
the pru be jump on the green bandwagon and as one of britain 's major motor insurer be encourag car owner to convert they vehicle to unleade petrol . the pru have half a million motorist on it book and be send they each a booklet when they policy be renew explain the benefit of conversion . david roper , markete executive , say : car exhaust emission be a major source of lead pollution in the	atmosphere	, which can have long term effect to health , particularly young child . a recent rac survey show that nearly six out of 10 car owner do not know if they car can run on lead - free fuel . we hope the leaflet we be send out to we motor policyholder will bring home to they the fact that many car can be convert both simply and cheaply .
he have try to stiffen the side defensive , to teach the virtue of match - long discipline mark without stifl he player 's natural creative talent . with the south american championship trophy on the sideboard and the side safely through to next summer 's world cup final , it would seem that the lazaroni system have work pretty well so far . against italy , lazaroni be keen to experience a foretaste of the	atmosphere	that he and he side can expect next summer . key figure in the new - look brazilian team be the goalkeeper , taffarel , the libero , galvao , the midfield ball winner , dunga and alemao , and the striker , bebeto and , of course , careca . when ask to assess the opposition , manage lazaroni reply diplomatically that he fear no single italian player , rather he fear the whole side .
roslavl 's official would have lain quieter in they bed at night if they have bother to read maxim gorky 's book on the russian peasantry publish that same year . he point out that peasant opposition to government do exist , but on account of russia 's huge distanc it express it very by evasion than through open fighte . this psychology naturally linger on into the supposed liberal	atmosphere	of nep in the form of the utopian hope that obligation impose from the centre , as the peasant put it , could be avoid , whilst retain economic right . at the end of the winter of 19212 a cautious directive go out from roslavl ' party headquarter to all local head collector of the tax in kind . they be not to put undue pressure on the peasant they , but only on they fellow subordinate collector .
one kolkhoz far to the north - east of smolensk exchange potato for farm machinery , whilst another shef factory that manufacture spare parts for linen plant give iron to a local kolkhoz on it visit . it insist on call a separate meet for the kolkhoz woman , so as to persuade they of they independence from they menfolk . an undate set of questionnaire in the 1922 file for the roslavl 's area reveal the prickly	atmosphere	that prevail between the busybody from the town , as the rustics perceive they , and the primitive mor of the rustics they . when ask if they shefi act in too authoritarian a manner , some kolkhozniki at first say it be very rare , but then in peasant fashion slowly warm up to the fact that they have be very anger by some young student who have write in rabochii put that they horse be bad f and clean , and that they have not sown enough crop . the arrogance of bolshevik - inspired youth towards the patriarchal rural community also transpire from other criticism directe against young visitor .
you can trust jim , be labou be appeal , reminiscent of a friendly village bobby or a family doctor of the old school . he prove to be the much effective prime minister since macmillan 's first phase . in the cabinet , callaghan 's open method and refusal to countenance conspiracy make for a very harmonious	atmosphere	than ever prevail under harold wilson ( now lord wilson of rievaulx ) . even the left - w tony benn be relative quiescent , not little perhaps because he be now the bringer of good news at the department of energy , as north sea oil begin to flow in large quantity . no doubt , callaghan have he limitation .
but the achievement be always precarious and be maintain only with some difficulty . with the mount balance - of - payment crisis , the tuc be reluctantly persuade in the summer of 1976 to renow a virtual wage - freeze policy with a limit of 5 per cent increase for the next twelve month . the financial	atmosphere	be dire at this period . even so , the new relationship between government and the unions be unlikely to last , at little on the present basis . jack jone tell healey that summer : we will have to get back to normal collective bargain .
situate in a quiet , residential area of melton mowbray , wexford house be the first eagle lodge to open . purchase by the association in may 1989 , extensive alteration be necessary to convert it to provide for eight resident , the first of who arrive in september 1990 . it be gratify that the initial resident have buil up a very happy family	atmosphere	, and have express they thanks to the association for provide they with what they now regard as they home . wexford house have demonstrate that the eagle lodge concept should be a success . woodford .
locate in southport , woodford be the association 's second eagle lodge , and can accommodate nine resident . formerly a private hotel , it have need only a little work to convert it to it new use . six resident be currentle live there and enjoy the comforts of a very home	atmosphere	. woodford be develop as an initiative by the north western area . the white house .
the principal architect of the cwgc , sir edward maufe , conceive the design of the runnymede memorial . he be deternin to use the dramatic location and it view to make a powerful memorial rather than to build a lofty edifice that would dominate the skyline . he objective be to create an	atmosphere	of quiet and intimacy , so he make a garden , then a cloister and a shrine . the cloister include panel that list the name of 20, 435 airman , group according to the year of death . the structure be in portland stone with westmoreland green slate roof , while the shrine it be a square tower that be , coincidentally , slight reminiscent of an airfield control tower .
but what irk he much be bishop 's meeting . towards the ecumenical movement , as a system of vast christian jamboree like the meet at amsterdam , he suspicions deepen . he attend a meet at lund in sweden in 1952 and think the	atmosphere	happy but the meet useless and wonder whether the day of such occasion be not past . but the assemb which shock he be the next , at evanston in the unite states in 1954 . he hat what he see at evanston .
the welfare state brighton speech , 12 october 1961 the roman poet say , dutce est desipere in loco , an opportunity for indiscretion be sometimes pleasant . if the doctrine of collective responsibility can never quite be forget or discard , at little it weigh much light on the wearer in the bracing , not to say rarefy , intellectual	atmosphere	of the cpc . therefore i do not see why tonight i might not occasionally , if the argument should lead that way , be guilty of say in office some of the thing which i have say out of office . the plowden report on control of public expenditure contain , amongst other nugget of wisdom , the follow sentence which i should like to take as i start - point : the social change of the last fifteen year have alter the incidence of hardship , so that there now may well be excessive social service for some purpose and inadequate one for other .
one be the need for reassurance in a world of visible consolidat great power from the unite states in the west to the teutonic and slav empire in europe and the east . the recessional of 1897 be not the hymn of a nation strong in it own security . in the 1890 the	atmosphere	be not of that settle calm with which it be credit by late and even very anxious generation . however confident the mass of the population may have feel in the durability of britain 's world role , that who rule in britain know full well the kind of danger the country face and the need to take step to meet they it would need a profound belief in providence to make one refrain from wonder why a group of foggy island off europe 's north - western shore , populate beyond the means of subsistence that the island could provide , endow with no great natural asset outside the coalfield , should have become both the centre of a world empire and a possible arbite of european rivalry .
there be a number of showcase venue around london , many of they connect to studio . often , showcase take place in the afternoon . to create much of an	atmosphere	, you could invite some of you ardent fan to indulge in the free drink and snack which be general provide for the guest , along with a band publicity pack . this should contain band photo , a demo tape and a biography . successful showcase can create substantial industry inter in a band , but if you be go to pull out all the stop , you have to spend a lot of money with no guarantee of a positive result .
eliot go on to wish for a combination of religious , anthropological , and neurological knowledge as exemplify by rome , cambridge , and harley street . harley street be also the business premise of some of london 's lead psychoanalyst . write about the novel in 1 927 , eliot state that nearly every contemporary novel know to i be either directly affect by a study of psycho - analysis , or affect by the	atmosphere	create by psycho - analysis , or inspire by a desire to escape from psycho - analysis eliot emphasize the danger of this and draw attention to the importance of the jamesian stress on the whole deep mystery of man 's soul and conscience . but there seem little doubt that the psychoanalyst 's stress on the childhood root of adult problems play it part in the general investigation of primitive root which fill sweeney agonistes .
after that they slip into anonymity , disappear altogether into the building surround they , turn into workshop for alloy weld and serious industrial accident . the dale , perhaps for the only time in it short life , be full . the word anticipatory fall limply from it first syllable in it attempt to describe the	atmosphere	, recharge from row to row . yoing next to old , do - well next to down - and - out : a heterogeneous mass present for it own mutually exclusive reason . the buzz , the uninhibit , excited talk , yes , uninhibit talk , in a district where you be make to feel peculiar if you allow any expression to cross you face in the street , dy as the light slowly fade .
barbara samuels cinephile the national film theatre in london show a wonderful variety of film but obviously have little of the	atmosphere	of the high street picture palace . even the bar and foyer be reminiscent of nothing so much as an airport lounge , an impression reinforce by the tannoy announcement of five , three and one minute call for casablanca . paris texa and roma .
this be only one respect in which camp delight in the selfsame artifice which other distrust . orton 's intention be to outrage . have he be alive he would doubtless have be delight at the response of the lead conservative theatre critic to what the butler saw ( 1969 ) : orton 's terrible obsession with perversion , which be regard as have bring he life to an end and chok he very high talent , poison the	atmosphere	of the play . and what should have be a piece of gaily irresponsible nonsense become impregnate with evil . perhaps hobson speak truer than he know , for the play be a kind of gay non - sense :
phil step right up and tinkl out dang man and the theme from robinson crusoe . ( years late , he come down to a jam with the pistol when i think we need a keyboard player . there be a funny	atmosphere	all the time he be there then after he will leave , the other guy turn to i and say , what you do bring a sooty down ) another thing that cut i off from the other kids be go to the grammar school and have to wear a bright green blazer every day . there be quite a few asian kids at the school but very few black particularly few when you consider how black west london be .
( form schoolfriend recall an occasion when mrs thatcher , as a young mp , return to she old school as chief speaker at a dinner for old girl , and correct the headmistress , who be a classical scholar , on the pronunciation of she latin . ) david howell do not remember he time in cabinet with much pleasure some argument just leave such acrimony and ill - feel that i can not believe they really could have be enjoyable i think the general	atmosphere	in the government of which i be a member be that everything should start as an argument , continue as an argument and end as an argument . she frequent denunciation of high level of taxation and public expenditure , of big government , and of the diminution of individual freedom and choice be passionate and deep feel ; they be express in attack on the baneful , almost immoral , effect of inflation and of government which debase the currency , or borrow rather than balance they income and expenditure . for all the pejorative talk of she be an ideologue , however , she be a practical conservative .
apart from nigel lawson , nichola ridley , cecil parkinson , and sir geoffrey howe , it be difficult to think of other cabinet minister who would be regard as economically dry or ideologically thatcherite , and both lawson and sir geoffrey have well - publicize difference of opinion with mrs thatcher . mrs thatch 's style certainly contribute to the cabinet division between 1979 and 1981 and again after 1987 . she have strong view on many issue and she propensity to express she view boldly at the outset of a cabinet discussion , combin with a sometimes dismissive attitude towards oppose colleague , tend to change the	atmosphere	and polarize cabinet discussion . this contrast with the approach of some other prime minister . attlee , macmillan , wilson , and callaghan often wait for a policy line in cabinet discussion to emerge before committ they .
fenna , i command you . go to rachel . then maggie follow the thread back through the	atmosphere	barry . she be blast by the friction of re - entry , scorch by she wild rush through particle and atoms of welcom air , hurl through the orbit phase . she crash through the glass of she own skylight .
i also think that apart from the corporate plan , the strategy and the mission statement , you really do need to give some vision about the future of you company and a vision in which that work with you can share . you can usually tell an organisation that have a clear corporate plan but very little vision about the future . the lack of vision be reflecte in the	atmosphere	among the staff and all the employee . cuckney also feel that a top executive need to set an example by be something of an entrepreneurial risk - taker . there be a need for an entrepreneurial spirit .
as he recall : you have to be able to tangle with fair tough and earthy , but likeable and well - mean , people . he stay in dig in a colliery village at the time and find it equally possible to integrate easy into the local community . he detect no	atmosphere	of they and we , though he suspect that in similar circumstance today it might be a different story . he have be promise that once he have obtain he colliery manage 's certificate , he would be make an assistant manage . he receive he certificate in july 1947 but the british coal industry have be nationalise in january of that year and he new boss tell he that in the changed circumstance they would not be able to carry out the undertak he have be give .
roddick do not offer any resistance , because at the time she be a frustrated actress and she feel teach english and history to a class of forty kid at a local secondary school be the next good thing to act . it be not a hardship because good teaching be theatre . i learn how to create	atmosphere	so that the classroom be a visual delight . i always do thing differently . friday afternoon i do a course in aesthetics and i be allow to paind the classroom an old nissen hut black and red .
malawi have not be debilitate by localism , and experience considerable economic growth in the 1960 and 1970 with a strong agricultural performance and an unusual effective civil service . the economic problems experience in the 1980 be large due to the destabilizing impact of the civil war in mozambique . nonetheless , the authoritarian nature of the regime have win it many enemy both inside and outside the country , create an	atmosphere	of suspicion and intrigue amongst the educated elite . furthermore , there be no sign that dr banda will be able to engineer a smooth and last transition to a leader with widespread popular support , and he thus endanger the achievement of he regime . malawi 's experience illustrate fundamental problem in the complex interweaving of traditional and modern value which coexist in africa .
in 1982 the presidency be constitutionally assume by biya who continue he drive to modernize the economy . however , by mid 1983 ahidjo evidently regret he decision and sotch to exercise control , partly from monaco , over the government from he position as party chairman . the subsequent tension between the two man create an	atmosphere	in which there be two attempted coup in 1983 , both emanat from sections of the army loyal to ahidjo . by the end of the year , biya feel strong enough to force a showdown with ahidjo and the latter lose the position of party chairman while still abroad . ahidjo do not subsequently return to cameroun , and in the presidential election of january 1984 biya receive a ye vote of over 90 per cent , which many camerounian consider to be a genuine indication of he underlie support .
the civil servant 's reluctance would be resolve by a ministerial directive that the project must be support some action be always good than none , the project would have an impact in several region , if it work it would boose export and create employment . the snag lie in the price of meat , the bank wante it raise to choke off local demand and free meat for export , the government wante it hold at it current low level to keep urban meat - eater happy . have flag the issue and fir the interest of the minister , the bank duo return to the cooler , very workman - like	atmosphere	of life in nairobi almost certain that sooner or late a project would go to the bank board , and that it would almost certainly be appro . in fact it take another two year for the project to be fully study , for the government to support it formal submission to the world bank , for the bank 's board to apprive it and for the first tranche of fund to flow . the project be high imaginative , builde on a commercial ranch project which already exist .
despite it usefulness as an introduction to the subject , it do , however , judiciously avoid overt criticism of it subject and devote little analysis to the si in it mature phase . nevertheless , wollen present a lucid account of the movement in it formative period and make an interesting case for andr breton as a figure of some distinction in french intellectual history . he also trace the hegelian , and lukcsian influence on leftist theory in france in the heighten intellectual	atmosphere	after the liberation which provide the aesthetic and political context for the situationist . apart from wollen 's historical and theoretical essay , the other major contribution in the boston text be thomas y. levin be dismantl the spectacle : the cinema of guy debord . this be again a comprehensive and thorough investigate article and be probably the first extend account of situationist cinema in english .
it surface , bring feeling of humiliation and chagrin and caus conflict in the family . british society serve in fact to keep izzat alive . the contempt for asian culture , the constant shadow of racial hostility and the disregard for family and group identity provide an	atmosphere	in which izzat be constant at risk and therefore be constant charge and recharge . as a result the woman suffer ; they be make the scapegoat of damaged izzat . it be they , after all , who have always be the symbol of they culture and traditionally it be at they slight touch that the delicate flower of izzat can shrivel .
one of this role , give to asian woman by they family and community , be to be the upholder and preserver of we culture . so what happen if a woman wish to have she own identity and wear clothes which she alone ha choose all too often the love relationship turn will , the easy relax	atmosphere	around the subject of clothes become one of anger and outrage . it be obvious that very than modesty be at stake . for example , certain material such as denim and corduroy be consider by orthodox muslims as unpleasant western stuff , unsuitable for woman 's clothing .
the first time i wear jean i do not dare wear they with a sweater . so i buy a long top , which come well below i hip , to wear with they . i be really scar , the	atmosphere	become very stiff but nobody say anything . in the evening i mother say i do not like this clothes but you can do what you like . you have change so much , you be a different person from what you use to be .
he say you be never to wear that clothes or i will throw you out of the house i . for the girl this be only one side of the picture . on the other be the	atmosphere	in school , with it contempt of anything indian or pakistani , which impress on they that western dress be superior to anything asian . for parent too ( particularly for sikh parent ) there be another aspect of they life which control they behaviour in this circumstance . it be the position they family occupy in the hierarchy of they particular community in britain .
the machine in the spr department give off chok fume and a grey pall seem to hang over the department about 90 per cent of the work force be colour , many of who cannot speak english . i count only six white worker in the factory , half of which seem to be of below average intelligence . the total work force equal 150 , it be not that the worker all look rather miserable and depress and the work	atmosphere	be not at all pleasant . i be not allow to speak to the worker it seem that they trade union membership be not allow by the management . what kind of people constitute the management of spiralynx
she must wait month , if not year , for an interview with an entry clearance officer at a british diplomatic mission on the indian subcontinent , go through endless interrogation about such subject as the colour of the family 's goat or the number of room in the house she life in or how many guest there be at the wedding and what happen on the wedd night . other member of she family be also ask the same question , and if there be the slight discrepancy it can be use as proof that she be not the person she claim to be . the woman i speak to who have be through the whole procedure tell i of the many exhaust visit they have have to make to the british embassy and high commissions , of the	atmosphere	of contempt at this place , of the pettiness of the entry clearance officer ( eco ) and interpreter , and the rude and unreasonable question they have have to answer . they tell i that sexual examination be a routine part of the entry certificate procedure at british diplomatic mission in the indian subcontinent . when i ask alex lyon about this in an interview in early 1976 he answer be :
i could not help remembere the pleasure i have have in i clothes , how keen i mother have be on i wear they , how we have often design they and choose they together and i mother have make many of they . to go back to pakistan again it would be like dy . and when i think of i daughter grow up in that	atmosphere	, in that society , i feel i must try to avoid it if in any way i can . but i cannot live without i husband . i love he so much i cannot ever imagine leave he .
he daughter ignore he . one of that black and white house it be . terrible ancient and full of	atmosphere	. of course , the surgery part be all modern . new copy of nova and elle .
by the time uniforms be don and inspection complete , the time for the parade it be draw near . almost five hundred friend and relative have make the trip to winchester , to encourage and support the recruit due to graduate to the status of trained light division soldier . the contribution make by this visitor to the	atmosphere	and overall success of the day be considerable for many of they , it be they first taste of the life now fully adopt by they son , brother and boyfriend who be now on parade . they be impress at the speed and efficiency with which the spectacle unfold . the march at 140 pac per minute ( noticeable swifter than the much conventional pace ) , the bugle call in lieu of word of command and the famous final double - past be all hallmark of the distinctive style of the division .
the tinc benz and zinc oxide plaster treatment be the cornerstone of blister therapy ; however , the sergeant 's foot be so damage that a layer of moleskin ' have to be apply . now a new man , the sergeant march out gratefully , ready for another day . by 1500 hour the	atmosphere	in the british medical facility be frenetic . the wait area be overflow , with much than 200 marcher anxious expecte treatment . two nco driver from the field ambulance be pass through the assembled ranks sell chocolate , bun and cold drink .
every year , the nijmegen march be accompany by a carnival in the town . a band play at every street corner , crowd drift from bar to beer stand to disco and back to bar . the	atmosphere	be relax and friendly as the marcher and they supporter wind down after a hard day . the field ambulance minibus run the boy down into town , and bring they back to camp in hourly shuttle until 0300 hour . that be a great day , say a happy but exhausted lance - corporal , and look what i have get .
the much serious and devastat wood fundus and the specy much frequently find in old building be dry rot or serpula lachryman . have establish it in damp timber , this infection can spread to dry wood and brickwork . it life - cycle start with a spore , of which there be countless millions in the	atmosphere	. this spore be high resistant tot extreme of heat and humidity and be very long - li . a spore which land on wood with a moisture content of 2025 per cent in a still and stuffy atmosphere where the temperature be between 7 and 27c ( 44 and 80 f ) can germinate and then throw out hollow strand know as hypha .
it life - cycle start with a spore , of which there be countless millions in the atmosphere . this spore be high resistant tot extreme of heat and humidity and be very long - li . a spore which land on wood with a moisture content of 2025 per cent in a still and stuffy	atmosphere	where the temperature be between 7 and 27c ( 44 and 80 f ) can germinate and then throw out hollow strand know as hypha . this initially hair - like fibre seek out and feed off the cellulose in the wood which be digest by the fungus to leave a dry , desiccate and fragile shell of wood - fibre or lignin which , in the absence of the cementitious cellulose , cannot continue to perform any structural role require of the timber . have draw the cellulose from one section of the wood , the hyphae reach on to adjacent sections of timber to continue the process , while the strand of the initial attack unite into an equally fast - spread cotton - wool - like grow known as mycelium .
when this action be well establish , the fungus will produce a sporophore , or fruit body , which produce million of spore . the sporophore be at first a whitish - grey , unpleasant - look fleshy growth and gradually become much leathery and dewy . it burst at internal to release into the	atmosphere	an enormous number of rusty - red spore which be carry on the breeze to germinate in distant damp timber , start the process afresh . dry rot exhibit an almost uncanny knowledge of the presence of timber and be able to thrust through brickwork mortar joint and to travel across brickwork behind plaster over great distanc in it search for fresh food . in this respect , it be quite capable of spread from one building to another through a thick party wall .
each wheel be make in sections and assemble at the mill , paddle make of wood be retain . iron fitting could replace wooden component gradually , allow major alteration to take place over a long period . this	atmosphere	of make change only slowly and of preferr a try and test free source of power to very efficient engine - driven plant can be savoure at lockyer 's mill , clapton , near crewkerne , somerset , a mill of 1864 in which grain be still mill commercially by water power provide by the river axe ( plate 42 ) . as well as mill cear , water - power mill have be use for weave and spin . in sheffield , until the 1930 , pow from a waterwheel be even use to grind cutlery .
i just hope that there be nothing to this werner business . i god , i hope not . behind he , in the flat on klara - lettkin - strasse , there be a cheerful	atmosphere	. touch by she husband 's bring she coffee frau nordern be in a good humour , dismisse she own worry about the accident as mere alarmism stok by bodo , and temper she authoritarian way by let paul stay in bed for an extra fifteen minute instead of , as usual , rouse he in the manner of a sergeant in charge of a penal battalion . the arrival of the mail hel , too : a mound of letter from the relative who be , or , if they be to be give free accommodation , think that they be , come to uncle karl 's party .
this vine - leaf bowl with it cargo of glossy lemon come from a pottery founded in the 1920 by a member of the bloomsbury group , phyllis keye . after the second world war the pottery move to tingewick , the keye family house , where it continue under the aegis of phyllis 's great - niece , sara johnson . the pottery retain the	atmosphere	of a family business : the exclusive design be hand - glaze with meticulous care , in colour that be they hand - mix . there be a small stock in the pottery but much of the work be commission . this bowl cost 70 , the fruit from 7 .
nichola luard of the john muir trust ( husband of we cookery writer elisabeth luard ) have join force with local people to form the bara ceirch conservation group , name after the farm on which the conifer plantation be sit . the group be only too aware that the danger of conifer plantation be not limit to create great black tract of sterile land ( nothing grow beneath they dense needle ) . very worryingly insidious be they ability to act as magnet to acy rain , take it from the	atmosphere	and release it into the soil , where it leach down and enter the water system . nicholas luard and the other member of the group be particularly concern about the plant of conifer at bara ceirch farm as it stand at the headwater of the river cothi and towy , two of the fine salmon river in wales . the plantation it be close to a feed stream that run straight into the cothi , as would acy take in by the conifer .
an occasional distraction , an even very seductive glow , be the full moon hang over the sea , right in the middle of i window . as a child i have a japanese black - lacquer box , inlaid with a moon in mother - of - pearl , shimmer above dark island . that be the scene before i now , except that the moon , rid low in it arc and view through the earth 's dusty	atmosphere	, be spuriously tinge with gold . in spring or autumn , the moon have sometimes tempt i out to walk the shore , confident of magical encounter . but along that bare and silvery rim of sand , any self - respect wild thing could not fail to see i first .
efficiency at first glance chp seem inefficient but it be not . conventional electricity generation lose to the	atmosphere	enough heat for the need of every home , office and factory in the country . estimates put grid - generate pow at 25 % to 35 % efficiency after heat and transmission loss . a hotel 's conventional boiler for heat production alone usually achieve 70 % and standby electricity generator , 50 % .
with all the problem face we at home , what have the rainforest get to do with we in fact they be the key to we survival and we planet 's future . this be because the deliberate burning of the rainforest pump hundred of million of tonne of carbon dioxide into the	atmosphere	. carbon dioxide be the main cause of global warm the greenhouse effect . we now know this threaten to dramatically alter the world 's weather pattern , raise sea level and bring flood , drought and famine to we and the third world .
the smoke this produce be so dense that it close airport and smother half the country . the result of this wilful burning reach far beyond the rainforest . hundred of million of tonne of carbon dioxide be pump into the	atmosphere	each year from tropical forest burn , contribute to the greenhouse effect or global warm which could severe disrupt the world 's climate . rainforest be the source of a multitude of raw material with immense potential value to medical science . many of this will be lose forever , before they have even be name .
the greenhouse effect be now the e world be much press environmental problem . one of the solutions be to protect the rainforest . visible light from the sun pass through the	atmosphere	to the earth 's surface . heat radiation leave earth . some escape , but gase in the atmosphere trap the rest , keep the earth warm .
last year he be invite to hold an exhibition of he work at urbino , in central italy , at the house once own by the renaissance painter raphael , which he have visit a few year before . it be the first time that such an offer have ever be make ; initially , he be loath to put he sketch on public display but he be also flatter . final , after some agonize , he agree on the ground , as he wrote in the introduction to the catalogue , that i have a passion for italy , she people , she countryside and the way in which art quite naturally seem to invade every aspect of life , thereby produce an	atmosphere	that be totally irresistible . he send the painting but none be for sale . as he explain in urbino , this sketch be very much a part of i and i be sure that who paind they will understand how hard it be to part with something into which , when inspire , you have poure you heart and soul .
and on the other burning question that be ask time and time again whether she will have much child he say , dig an even deep hole for he : she will love a large family because she know the joy of it . she like the	atmosphere	of a large family . i be quite sure she will like to have several much child yet five seem a good number . there be time when i wish she could have a couple of year off to bring up she child , be at home with they , and not worry about anything else apart from they and she husband .
the answer be that he have flow out quite coincidentally to attend a wedding . the princess would like much child . she would dearly love some daughter to be able to pass she jewellery on to and , come from a large family , she enjoy the	atmosphere	that plenty of child create . the prince would no doubt also like to have much child , but he be very tear over the question of population control . have witness the horrify poverty and hunger in country where there be just not enough food to feed the teem mass , he feel depress and worry about the future .
it be all different here . everyone be on the ground floor in chalet wooden chalet in field of grass . the	atmosphere	be different too . there be much hope here . in ardeevan we just lie and rot and nothing ever happen between doctor staples 's weekly round except that someone dy .

but this be in many way a blessing . too many studio have be buil in britain during the production boom and , at a time when filmmaker be anyway keen than they have be hitherto to get out among ordinary people , they find they be no long constrain by anxious accountant determine to maximize the use of studio space . among that who find wartime location shoot refreshing be the actor michael redgrave who credit much of the quality in the way to the star ( 1945 ) , asquith 's atmospheric picture about life on an airforce base , to the	atmosphere	of that three week at catterick , which could never have be create in the studio . sfilmmake be constrict as to subject matter by the requirement that they film contribute in some way to the war effort . that be the deal to keep british filmmaker in business which alexander korda have propose to government , and support with he propaganda film , the lion have wings ( 1939 ) , combin documentary footage with patriotic clip from early feature film and a contemporary narrative full of pontification on britain 's purpose in go to war .

the uk government , follow the example of the french and italians , institute measure to strengthen the ability of local producer to secure a reasonable return from the domestic box office , and filmmaker develope undemand form of cinema , mainly comedy and war film , that would reliable appeal to native audience . meanwhile , cinema admission decline steadily , from 1 , 365 million in 1951 to 501 million in 1961 , reinforce the impression of limpness that hang around the whole of the british film industry . the powerhouse of film production in the previous decade nearly all wilte in this	atmosphere	. only alexander mackendrick at eal and david lean seem able , to some extent , to sustain they early initiative , the one by focus an acerbic eye on the state of england , the other by apply he extraordinary craftsmanship to such international film as the bridge on the river kwai ( 1957 ) and lawrence of arabia ( 1962 ) . powell and pressburger make they last disillusion statement on the post - war mood in the small back room ( 1949 ) , the story of an explosive expert 's struggle against drink and pain that be they first film after the defection to korda .

for queen and country ( sony ) be a tough and effective british urban western confront racism and inner - city deprivation in uncomplacently stylised term . represent a much traditional form of british cinema , john schlesinger 's madame sousatzka ( virgin ) have a stand - out performance by shirley maclaine and a keen eye for vary london location , while a time of destiny ( vestron ) be a baroque romantic melodrama from gregory nava ( el norte ) , which despite the miscast of william hurt as a basque immigrant 's son seem to i to have be unfairly downgrade . another flaw but strike recent movie be doa ( buena vista ) , an update from the creator of max headroom of the classic 1949 thriller of the same name , which may detrimentally alter the plot of the original but boast nonetheless some arrest high - tech intimation of neo - expressionist	atmosphere	. need no alibis , however , though it come close to an exploitation concept , be the hard - drive australian movie shame ( vestron ) , with a dynamic central performance by deborra - lee furness as the city woman catch up in outback violence . speak of exploitation , student of the genre might care to consider trapper county war ( guild ) , an archetypal example of the backwood nightmare , set in one of that supposed hillbilly community where the local , when not spitt out tobacco or imprecation , be band together to hunt down interloper and blast they to bit .
one answer be that he be so explicit in he stage - direction that he leave designer and director little freedom of manoeuvre . boldly ignore the shavian prescription , nancy meckler 's high original share experience production of heartbreak house at the riverside studio have the quality of a fragment dream , only occasionally mar by a sock - it - to - em over - emphasis . write between 1913 and 1919 , shaw 's masterpiece famously begin with an	atmosphere	: that of culture , leisure country - house england embrace the cataclysm of the first world war in a fever death - wish . down in captain shotover 's nautical sussex retreat , civilisation be see as a ship on the rock . the utterword and the hushabye represent , respective , the last vestige of colonialism and bohemianism .

the stoppage be be organise by factory committee . mr jakes will face he toughest test yet when he confront an emergency meet of the central committee this week . it be not impossible , in this highly char	atmosphere	, that the party leader will be replace by the weekend . each demonstration this week have show an increase in confidence which it will be very difficult to stop . mr stepan 's reference to criminalise element take advantage of a destabilised situation , like mr jakes 's reference to ruthless manipulator sound odd out of date .
in what be a highly fluid situation , a senior opposition source say that he expect forum minister to be in office by the weekend . the forum source say that the communist may retain half the cabinet seat , but that this be the absolute maximum the party could expect . it be clear that the long the current unstable crisis	atmosphere	persist , the stronger the opposition 's bargain position become . if it demand for a representative government be not meet there be like to be a general strike on monday . mr urbanec , who be to hold further talk with mr havel today this time in front of television camera conced that the party realise it be hold in deep mistrust by the public , and accept that henceforth it could only be part of the political spectrum .

two of the er instrument have be provide by the uk . the active microwave instrument radar system , buil by marconi space system , be significant because it can be use over land or ocean : it will return vital information about how the wind interact with wave . how the wind affect the ocean and modify the heat exchange with the	atmosphere	be not well understand , but be of paramount importance to weather forecaster who cannot wait for er - 1 to begin operation . though esa admit there have be electronic problem with one of the system 's processor , it be hardly surprise . it be the much complex instrument we have ever buil , say joe mccaughey , marconi 's project manage .
the rutherford appleton laboratory in oxfordshire have provide the along - track scann radiometer , an infrar instrument which will measure sea surface temperature down to 0.3c . there be american who will give they eye tooth for this sort of data , say one er project scientist at the laboratory . this great accuracy will allow the heat transfer between the ocean and the	atmosphere	to be good compute . commercially , the atsr data will allow fish vessel to home in on the edge of sea currents where fish congregate to feed on nutrient bring up from the ocean floor . but the emphasis for er - 1 be science , as the er programme be esa 's contribution to woce , the world ocean circulation experiment , an important part of global climate research in the 1990 .
similarly , the mechanism for heat transport in ocean current be also mysterious , as the amount of both heat and water within they be not well define . nearly 10 per cent of the earth 's surface be cover by ice , which remain as terra incognita to climatologist as it be to 17th - century explorer . ice coverage limit the exchange of heat between the	atmosphere	and ocean , effective insulat polar region from sunlight during summertime . you will be amaze how little we know about the polar region , say dr preben goodmandsen of the technical university of denmark . during the wintertime , there be no sunlight .
instead of melodrama , we get tragedy . instead of the medical materialism of hammer horror , we get a surprisingly restrained treatment of the play 's fuliginous cruelty : even when the duchess be invade by a chorus of madman , they be usher in one at a time by a beady - eye supervisor wield a corrective cane . i one reservation be that mr alexander deny he expressive use of light and sound to convey	atmosphere	and leave we with few memorable image . in strive for sobriety , he production be just a shade dry . coliseum .

the public perception of amnesty have also change and this have not happen by accident . for a long time deem a white , western organization , the setting up of section sin country like tunisia , algeria and south korea , be ample illustration of amnesty 's worldwide stature . as a multi - lingual movement the human right message can be convey via dozen of report , book and audio - visual material to	audience	from japan to nigeria . amnesty be global in name and nature . the very life blood of amnesty be it research team there be currently 40 base at the international secretariat in london .

artist own write van gogh be famous not only for he art , but for he write . he do not write an autobiography , but he letter have be a source of fascination to a wide	audience	, especially artist . lucky , he have a correspondent in he brother theo in who he could confide and with who he could explore idea about art ; the letter be thus an invaluable source of interpretation . from the distance of a century , some of van gogh 's enthusiastic appraisal of the art of he time look curious ; but then , this artist act as a critic be especially vulnerable to admir art with a moral purpose , or work from which he be able to draw inspiration .
this vital fact prove it method of manufacture do not correspond to it suppose date . the museum make the good of a bad job . joseph noble , the observant administrator , announce to an	audience	of eight hundred , it be famous , but it be a fraud . much than that , it be one of the much important classical art forgery ever discover . some museum have prudently keep a collection of mistaken purchase , and even buy some forgery deliberately .
the variation and exception to this brief generalised statement can be find in a number of book , some by investigative outsider , some in memoir by dealer and other interest in the market . for other period , historian be slowly make study which document the connection of critic and historian with the market . in 1959 dore ashton be dismiss by the new york times , the charge be that she article be not aim at a wide newspaper	audience	, and she article on work by artist friend give evidence of bias ( she husband , who work she be forbide to review , be a painter and print - maker call adja yunker ) . john canaday , the incom editor of the newspaper 's art page and responsible for the dismissal , have make a challenge to a climate of opinion in which dore ashton 's criticism be value for it sensitivity , and where the art which she praise be accept . she supporter include thomas hess , meyer schapiro , leo steinberg , harold rosenberg , and peter selz , and they intervention , assert that canaday have offend ashton 's right and responsibilitie as a critic , resulte in canaday 's be censure by the american art critic 's association .
the theatre be large than life , not in term of physical scale , but because movements and speech be comparative emphatic and intense , even when a play simulate everyday natural surrounding . some people find this make theatre less believable less true to they own experience and therefore less convince than the much restrained performance see on television and cinema . theatre invite you to give you full attention to what be happen on stage the theatrical experience be a very concentrate one and you as a member of the	audience	be vitally connect to what be go on . as part of the audience you be as much a part of the entertainment as the performance it , and this be something that dramatist be aware of and have always write for . sometimes you will be directly address by the character this be something which happen a great deal in greek and elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by chorus in act 4 , scene 1 of henry v , which draw the audience into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effective ) .

you local amateur society be always a good begin . be nervous and take risk be two of the main thing you will have to face as an aspir actor , and that first time you read a play with a group of stranger , rather than in a classroom or among friend be when you confront you first hurdle . but you may not actual learn much , simply because the main object of the group will not be to help you but to get on and do the play , rely on the skills available and hope that the	audience	will give adequate support . so what else can you do in recent year the amateur actor have have much opportunity for classes in theatre work , includ voice and movement train as well as performance and direct skills .

remember this when the pace hot up ! student usually find that the first term 's work be relative gentle . at nearly all school no stage performance will be see by an	audience	until at little the end of the second term . sometimes student get anxious about this , and believe they be not make audience contact early enough ; but if you think about it , the reasoning be clear . much of you technical tutor will be see everything you do , and derive what they need to know from it ; they do not want to find you confuse by criticism from senior student which might not be helpful to you at this point .

student may find they perform in final production over two full term , which mean they have the opportunity to play twice as many part , but this depend on the school 's policy and how they think you have progress . at this stage , too , the allocation of part and the standard of performance be become a lot very competitive a foretaste of the profession it . in many case student will also tour in production mount by the school , and this give good	audience	be usually either professionally interested , or be fellow student and friend . any programme of final drama school production will present a variety of style and the cast be aim at give student a chance to do well in suitable role . naturally , with a cast of actor who be all approximately the same age , the cast of heavy character part have to be consider very careful , and of course not all play be teem with character of similar age .
the actor be dependent on the stimulus of other face and voice . quite a number of new actor form small fringe group and work in play on a profit share basis and work opportunity may grow from such scheme . small , little - know group do not general muster a large	audience	, of course , but they be often a good way of commande inter from future employer . certainly the new actor should never remain idle but create chance wherever possible . this may sound like cold comfort when you be desperately hope for something to come along and get you go but continue you work and maintain skills be vitally important .
certainly the new actor should never remain idle but create chance wherever possible . this may sound like cold comfort when you be desperately hope for something to come along and get you go but continue you work and maintain skills be vitally important . above all you need new	audience	experience now you be out of drama school . and , although nobody wish to be exploit with low wage and very difficult condition , it be frankly good to find the way and means of present you somehow , than not perform at all . the new actor be general operat in top gear and if this momentum be stop it can be very damage to the morale and can result in an actor 's technical skills go rusty something to be avoid at all cost .
d.m . it be the much important medium for gette known by the general public and affect the attitude of employer but the theatre be still the good place for learn you trade . as richard attenborough once say to i , if you have not learnt to play to an	audience	that be present , how can you expect to play to one that be not
the previous scheme be now to be re - submit . problem like this arise from a lack of imagination in house management , but it must be acknowledge that the drink public behaf in a very inflexible way and fail to adap to the quality of different building . brewer may underestimate the sophistication of they potential	audience	, however . the availability of a period pub , particularly one represent the high popular 1930 , could create a new market where none exist before . this be the only hope for the conservation of pub from a period with plan idea so remote from we own .
peggy mitchell , seate at the rear of the variety tent , sigh in sympathy as , one after another , the right card fail to appear from or disappear into the deck . colonel feather 's face be get red , and he be begin to perspire . the small	audience	have begin to fidget on they rickety fold chair . a child 's pipe question about the next act a professional juggler currently on the variety bill in a nearby town be hurried hush , as much by the colonel 's glare as it mother 's whisper . the great whirlo and he potential fan would have to wait colonel feather be a determined man , and this be he moment .

another outstand box feature be simon and laura ( 1956 ) a comedy about live television production starr kay kendall and peter finch who wit and sharpness have not since be rivall by film on similar theme . she film be by no means as simple as they may have first appeare . they make deceptive subtle demand on they	audience	, and through all of they there run a strong sense of humour . she last film rattle of a simple man ( 1964 ) who commercial and critical failure end she career , can be see as a woman 's reply to the eulogy of the work class male celebrate by john osbourne and he like , and it do so by pok fun at the ideology of the male and he crude sexism . ironically , this film stand up good today than many of it male social realist counterpart .

ashton punctiliously follow the layout . but stravinsky 's music , although classical in form , be far from the tuneful dance idiom of tchaikovsky , stravinsky 's source of inspiration . despite strict rhythm and exact phrase , the music be daring frivolous in tone and quality because it be mean to entertain a popular	audience	. in follow stravinsky 's guideline , ashton find many new , sometimes frivolous , way of perform class - room step . the corp de ballet neglect the turn - out and step forwards sur le pointe , raise the working knee and rest the toe on the calf of the other leg , before move forwards .
this tell how the poet , have take opium , dreamt backwards through time to seek he love in a ballroom , on he way to a medieval scaffold , at a well in ancient greece and final at a witch sabbath , where she kiss end in death ( see page 56 ) . however , massine 's interpretation of brahm 's four symphony ( choreartium , 1933 ) be very different . it be the idea behind this design that so interest not only the	audience	but also the music critic of the time ( see page 41 ) . massine not only parallel the overall and short phrase rhythm of the music by that of the dancer , but the instrument of the orchestra by relate group of dancer . each group be lead by a soloist represent the leader of a particular orchestral section so that as the theme be take up by first one and then another section , the various group of dancer join in .
for example , when the musical phrase get complicated because of the use of many note , the dancer find they use they hand feverish in order to give every note it value . occasionally this can be intereste as it be in bintley 's consort lesson ( 1984 ) . but if it be repeat too often the incessant jigge of hand make the	audience	littrestle , too . a study of dalcroze eurythmics from which such idea emanate be valuable , but the practice must be use with discretion if the resultant ballet be not to resemble an examination of machinery rather than a feele fur the rhythm and shape of the engine that make the dancer perform . daphnis and chlo aston 's romitic style the lover be unite ( margot fonteyn , christopher gable and the royal ballet )
instead of concentrat on the line of the dance which they will need if they ever dance in ashton 's symphonic variation or monotone , macmillan 's requiem or bintley 's consort lesson student spend much time loosen up to meet the demand of modern choreographer . there be often a rush to create something new without enough think be give to the physical problem they may cause . there remain , however , a few dancer who excel in the purely classical role , which an	audience	demand because they be still tes ground for particular talent . purely classical ballet be still popular , so there have to be choreographer who understand and mould the technique . they must know how to make use of and when necessary discard the old conventional rule .
take place during a particular period and in a particular environment . this two requirement be first establish by greek playwright and be late codify by the acadmie franaise ( 1635 ) when it lay down rule for the composition of any literary work . the rule be still valid and the libretto of any ballet neglect they often fail to hold the attention of it	audience	because the content have be weaken by too many irrelevance . enigma variation ashton interpretation of elgar 's my friend picture within ' ( the royal ballet ) a play must have a begin , a climax and an end ( aristotle )
much other story ballet can be analys in much the same way . that with a theme , or which consist of dance only , have a similar plan . a choreographer who neglect the old rule and any item pertinent to the unfolding of the plot , theme or music be demande a great deal from an	audience	. many plotless or so - call abstract ballet , by choreographer such as balanchine , have no specific character or climax but they do follow the composer 's score very closely . many composer of special commissioned music , even tho late than stravinsky , follow the time - honour rule of thematic continuity and development and above all rhythmic phrasing .
this can be effecte by the use of a leitmotif or phras of music . since the first performance of giselle , certain composer and arranger have use leitmotif fur one or several character and repeat the leitmotif each time the character appear . this musical phrase give continuity to the action and be much valuable because they help both performer and	audience	to understand how moments in the story or theme affect the player . adolphe adam , composer of the music for giselle , initiate this idea which great influence wagner and late composer . leitmotif be a firm point of reference that carry the dancer onwards from the begin to the climax and to the end of the story .
when petrushka be leave alone in he room , he cry dominate the stage both musically and choreographically because the incessant throb be not hear . so when the cry be hear again just before the curtain fall it come as a final appeal for help . there be always a moment of silence before the	audience	respond , so strong have be the tension . prokofiev threade two leitmotif through he score for cinderella to mark the heroine and she fairy godmother . when ashton stage he version of the ballet he make cinderella 's leitmotif into a major factor fur the development of the plot by create a match dance leitmotif .
fokine be the first choreographer to distinguish the need for a particular style for each ballet when he create such different ballet as les sylphide , le carnaval , prince igor , the firebird and petrushka . from he innovation have come many development open the way for similar independently mind choreographer . they also opened the eye of the	audience	to the endless possibility of express mea through dance . three particularly objective master of choreography be de valois in job and the rake 's progress , massine with such different ballet as the good - humour lady and the three - corner hat and macmillan with mayerling and requiem . a subjective view
schoreographe can also take a very subjective view of they work . this be equally important and have so prove throughout ballet history . the choreographer seize on the personality of a particular dancer and create ballet through which the dancer gradually develop and disclose unique talent and quality to such a degree that	audience	soon recognise a star . the name of four choreographer immediately stand out . taglioni recognise he daughter marie 's quality of other worldliness in la sylphide ; perrot discover carlotta grisi 's unique quality as an actress - dancer in giselle ; fokine expose tamara karsavina 's many - sided brilliance in such work as the firebird , le carnaval and petrushka ; ashton foster margot fonteyn 's vary personality .
no good example can be give than by cit the career of tamara karsavina and margot fonteyn , both of who work with many different choreographer as well as submitt they to the severely classical discipline of the old petipa repertoire . a general view there be a third type of choreographer who produce ballet which give	audience	great pleasure through the sheer variety of they virtuoso design . because of the interesting , usually technical , demand make on the performer , they ballet often become testing ground for future soloist . variation from such ballet as petipa 's don quixote , raymonda and la bayadre and bournonville 's napoli be still consider by much classical dancer to be much technically demande than the much complex twisting and turnings of modern choreographer who mix they style .
a ballet fur the stage must have an overall rhythm which set the atmosphere , quality , mood and possibly the emotional content of the whole . and ballet must also have short phrase rhythm which will give it variety , dimension , mass , structure , texture and style . perhaps no ballet have ever make the same impact on dancer and	audience	as stravinsky 's rite of spring . it urgent _ rhythm command the choreographer to keep the dancer move forever onwards with great intensity to the climax , whilst the shorter phrase rhythm give the chosen maiden and small group such way of move that they hold the audience 's full attention until the fall of the curtain . variety

measurable extent of any kind ; number of unknown qualitie contain as factor in a whole dimension immediately suggest that the choreographer must take into account the space in which the dancer move . although this be of considerable importance , particularly if the ballet be to be present in a large theatre , too much concentration on certain of the dimensions ( height , depth or breadth ) may deprive some member of the	audience	of much of the pattern . for example , too much weave and roll of body on the floor be hardly visible from the stall , whilst too much concentration on one side of the stage find spectator on the same side cran they neck to see what be go on . it be for such reason that much of petipa 's famous pa de deux take place centre stage , whilst that of ashton and macmillan cover the whole area as befit they very flow lyrical style ,
it must also refer to the depth of think behind the design whether the subject deal with a bold tale or a subtle philosophical , psychological or even theological theme . it may even present a comic , frivolous or bawdy joke to arouse laughter or attempt to reveal the working of a composer 's mind . however , choreographer should always remember that whatever story , theme or music be choose , it must be translate into clear , often simple , dance statement understandable by an	audience	. it should not be necessary to compile long programme note , except perhaps in that case where a poem be be interpret ( see page 28 ) . schoreographe should never assume that all in the audience have sufficient knowledge of the subject , theme and idea which be possible understand only by an exclusive coterie of friend .
however , choreographer should always remember that whatever story , theme or music be choose , it must be translate into clear , often simple , dance statement understandable by an audience . it should not be necessary to compile long programme note , except perhaps in that case where a poem be be interpret ( see page 28 ) . schoreographe should never assume that all in the	audience	have sufficient knowledge of the subject , theme and idea which be possible understand only by an exclusive coterie of friend . this do not mean that only wellknown or straightforward subject and theme be to be stage . far from it .
shakespeare 's drama of hamlet , romeo and juliet and othello have many subtle touch of humour and tenderness , as do he lighter work such as a midsummer night 's dream . all have be translate into successful choreographic form . similarly the delicate and subtle nuance of such ballet as ashton 's a month in the country , robbin 's dance at a gathering and macmillan be song of the earth be successfully convey and capture the	audience	's attention from the moment the curtain rise by the impetus , rhythm , dimension and variety of dance . dance in all it aspect have prove capable of embrace the whole range of emotion and behaviour that emerge from a proper reading and understand of the text . mass
once an outline of the story and a general layout of the plot have be decide , they should be discuss with the composer or arranger of music who first task may be to create a proper begin with the overture . be it to set the general atmosphere and mood as stravinsky do for the firebird mysterious sound of the wind whisper in the tree , the soar flight of a bird and the heavy tread of an unseen foot be still a wonderful introduction to this magic tale . on the other hand , prokofiev use he overture to romeo and juliet to introduce the leitmotif which will help both dancer and	audience	to follow the unfolding of the plot . he contrast the love theme of romeo and juliet with that which accompany the bitter struggle and fight between montague and capulet . different again , the overture to a month in the country convey romantic nostalgium with deep hint of passion which lanchbery create when he arrange little - know music by chopin .
despite the general activitie there be menace in the air and it be not long before the rival faction of montagues and capulets be fight and deaths occurre before the lover even meet . this opening be very different from the quietly charm first scene of a month in the country , where the only thing amiss be natalia 's bore behaviou . even with such example in mind the choreographer may well decide it be good to delay the confrontation between the chief player because , by create and stresse the general atmosphere , this raise the	audience	's expectation before the meet of the protagonist , and the sudden onset of passion be what make the ultimate tragedy so poignant . this happen in giselle where hilarion 's suspicion of albrecht 's identity be already arouse before albrecht meet giselle . hilarion 's discovery of albrecht 's sword and late he confrontation with giselle , with the sword in he hand , still do not convince giselle of albrecht 's duplicity .
despite the great difference in style between the above three ballet and despite they different libretti the three choreographer perrot ( with saint - georg ) , macmillan and ashton give valid reason why the tragic deaths of giselle , romeo and juliet , and natalia 's lost love be the inevitable result of what have go before . in other word , what happen at the begin of the story state why the relationship between two or very character lead to confrontation which continue onwards to a climax and final draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion . this last task be possibly the much difficult because the	audience	must be convince that the ending chosen be the only possible outcome of everything that have go before . the ending can also owe a great deal to the composer or arranger of music . stravinsky ensure a happy yet solemn end to the firebird by use the old easter hymn at the gate where the whole congregation rejoice at the renewal of life .
texture arrangement of thread ; the characteristic feel or look of this arrangement this definition should be understand as the choreographer 's ability to establish a style of movement through which the	audience	will feel and understand what the performer be communicate through a particular way of dance . the style must disclose and be expressive of the mood , emotion and action of the role play even where few personal feeling be allow to show , as in such ballet as ashton 's monotone where all that be need be a calm , unhurry and seemingly endless weaving of the dance design in all it dimension . nevertheless the three dancer in monotone be express they close relationship to each other and to the space in which they dance and above all to the flow line of the design and of the musical phras .
or be he to allow she to rest she leave forearm on he right and to guide she round in an elegant mazurka lead she , as it be , from the shoulder so that she always move just in front of he such beautiful manner be quite unlike that of the ranch hand and they girl in de mille 's rodeo or that in macmillan 's elite syncopation . in addition to the courtesy the partner show to each other , there be also the courtesy that must be show to the bystander on stage during a pa de deux so that such reciprocation can help to focus the	audience	's attention on the context of the dance . the courtesy must also be exchange between couple in a group dance . this be very important where there be a constant change of partner .
it be equally important when she be wear a soft tunic or one - piece tight and leotard . the line make by the two dancer together must always have room to breathe and to be see separately if the whole design be to flow . it be possibly the spaciousness of design that bring	audience	again and again to ashton 's symphonic variation and monotone , who straighter and continuously move line require the dancer to draw they calmle and to fill the stage generously with movement . this could not be very different from the cruel flinge of mary vetsera 's body by rudolf in the mayerle pa de deux with which macmillan describe the count 's tragic mental state . technical characteristics
a contradiction in style during this change of aulement or alignment can distort the design . nevertheless an unusual change of aulement or alignment can add inter and draw attention to a dancer 's statement . for example : the swift change from the grand dvelopp la seconde which odile make face the	audience	and she sudden turn to arabesque when she look straight into the kneele siegfried 's eye in the act ii pa de deux of swan lake ; it be odile 's triumph for she know she have won siegfried 's heart . even very excit change of aulement can be find in ashton 's birthday offer where each soloist dance an old step at a new angle , without break the rule or old convention of nineteen - century ballet . he then give an entire new quality to the class - room exercise on which this enchanement be base .
birthday offer ashton 's technical virtuosity ( the royal ballet ) schoreographe who do not adhere strictly to the old convention of court etiquette realise that they total design will flow very easy because they dancer ' behaviou will appear much spontaneous and natural . for example : each soloist need not begin with a formal bow to a k or to the	audience	, nor end with another bow or consider pose ; but such behaviour may be include if the choreographer wish to locate dance in a particular century and probably a palace in which the story unfold . many new member of an audience have be know to object to the applause greet the last bow . it break the continuity of the dance .

this last convention be invaluable in early train because it help to stabilise balance during the transfer from one foot to the other and be also valuable in such ballet as birthday offer as it echo the period and style of glazounov 's music . but this would get very bor if use too often . another old rule decree that dancer never turn they back on the	audience	, because all have to face the k , the centre of attention . the turn of a dancer 's back can now become part of a beautiful line be make in a total picture . today 's dancer not only dance fur an audience .
a sudden change of aulement , an unusual turn in - out of leg or arm , or quick jump up and then down to the floor follow by a roll over or even a somersault can accentuate the particular place that unusual movement have in the whole design . swift change in the dimensions cover in any linear design be nowhere very obvious than in ashton 's five abstract ballet and he example be now be follow by david bintley in he choros and consort lesson . in fact such unusual movements often arouse the	audience	and they colleague . classical dance pattern in classical ballet the pattern and grouping delineate by the dancer 's body be usually symmetrical and evenly balance over the whole stage .
it should be not that a similar order of precedence exist in ashton 's scne de ballet as in petipa 's the sleep beauty which be suppose to be an evocation of a court ballet at the time of louis xiv . however , when ballet be perform for the public , professional dancer take the place of courtier and technical innovation have to be make . the dancer now appear on a stage before a wide	audience	or to the much important performer . they have to adap they movement to cover a large space which be like a box with one side only be open to public gaze . they have to pay great attention to the placing of each step and pose within the new framework .
it be when this mass of dancer divide and move to the side that the open space available for dancing be expose fur the first time . before this the slowmove dancer in they wide spread tutus and veil arm have hide it from view . it exposure prepare the	audience	for the brilliant solo to follow . when marie camargo shorten she skirt and remove the heel from she shoe , jump and batterie first enter the vocabulary . this lent brilliance to the footwork which become very intricate and thus very interesting .
be do away with actor and singer to tell the story as have happen hitherto . he insist that he dancer tell they own story by use the many conventional gesture familiar to theatregoer throughout europe . he explain the gesture in the libretto he prepare for he	audience	. as a greek and latin scholar he have find they descri in the work of ancient author who wrote about the mood , emotion and action of all the actor involve in they drama . by 1717 this gesture be accept practice by actor to reinforce the meaning of the word speak and particularly by member of the commedium dell'arte travell troupe who produce mime play .

bratfisch attempt to entertain the doomed couple at the last meet before they death and he sorrow as he come to the graveside of the murder . heroine be an object lesson in understatement . so explicit be the tiny gesture and the perfect time of exit and entrance that the	audience	be force to recognise the personal tragedy of a love that speak no word . although macmillan 's choreography fur both the above ballet be base on classical technique , it in no way conform to the old school of dance or conventional mime . to portray specific character , whether imagine or real ( some be know to member of the audience at the first performance of enigma variation and isadora ) , the would - be choreographer can use classical dance as a firm base but must pay much attention to he character as particular individual .

they cannot be too strict about this relationship , for the score , whether commission or arrange , will only give some flavour of the traditional way of sing and dance . this can be easy recognise if bizet 's music for carmen be compare with de falla 's fur the three - cornered hat . yet the former have sufficient spanish flavour , as do the minkus score fur don quixote , for	audience	to believe that character really would perform in the way they do to the kind of music provide . when dauberval remove to bordeaux , the audience , like that elsewhere in france , be large unaware of the grandeur of aristocratic entertainment . it welcome the new idea in la fille mal garde because the character portray be familiar and be live in the farm and vineyard .

in real life the onlooker be part of the activity and usually join in . in ballet such as petrushka and rodeo they be wander around , watch and occasionally respond to the dancer 's effort . but	audience	sit and watch can only join in the fun in they imagination and if the dancer be sufficient out - go . choreographer like bournonville often borrow from regional dancing , which he eager study wherever he travell . it be useful for would - be choreographer to examine he ballet and discover that he mostly set they in country possesse easy recognise characteristics .
this be follow by a wedding stage as if the bride and groom be be manipulate as puppet by a group of servant , a particular japanese theatrical tradition . the final scene be a formal celebration and prayer fur a wife give birth . the movements be strongly influence by the stylised bugako player and be appropriate to each scene , but odd enough the whole appeare too static , as if a series of japanis print be be parade before the	audience	. at this time a macmillan ballet be expect to be , above all , about dance . the apparent ritualistic pos , although strongly perform and easy to understand , do not appeal in the same way as he song of the earth .
here he create the many happy and not so happy incident that can occur on a skat rink where even a professional can miss a trick . jerome robbin have a knack of use occupational gesture in many of he work and much particularly in the concert , where the well - observe behaviou of the many different concert - goer arouse much laughter . that in the	audience	who have have to suffer such behaviour in a concert hall , whilst try to listen to a brilliant musician , know that he remark about certain character be only too true . whatever occupational gesture ( mime ) a choreographer choos to use in ballet , it must be envisage in terms of dance without the use of props . even such mundane task as eat or drink have find a place in some ballet .
no good example of such objectivity be ashton be own play of the onlooker in nocturne . he stand silent and still , watch the tragedy of the poor girl who be be reject by the rich man . he two tiny gesture say everything and express the	audience	's understand of the plot . he make one as if he should try and comfort she , but turn away , walk upstage and on the balcony with he back to the audience , raise he arm wide only to drop they helpless . no one could fail to understand the onlooker 's reaction to the tale just unfold .

composer , author , poet and painter , begin to strengthen the national feature of they work . much typical and traditional folk dance step and customs be absor into demi - caractre dance and be accompany by idiomatic feature from national music . when this happen , however , even the traditional feature become very stereoty because choreographer use only that which the	audience	could easy recognise and which be common see and hear in a particular country . it be from such traditional dance that fokine , at the instigation of diaghilev , devise the first truly national ballet by break away from the sterotyped step . instead , fokine base he design ( as do the composer stravinsky and the artist korovin ( late goncharova ) ) on the folk tale , customs , traditional dance and music of russia without in any way conform to the generally accept rule of classical technique .
the movements of hungarian dance be down to the earth whereas that of scottish highland dance be away from the earth . 3 in order to display particular native feature , the traditional circle , chain and couple dance formation must be break up and opened outwards so that the step be see clearly by the	audience	. this be after all what the first balletmaster do when professional appear on stage and be no long surround by the court where all eye be focuse on the k ( see page 76 ) . 4
he dance throughout have it base in the classical vocabulary but macmillan have colour it by gesture from cabaret and vaudeville dance tradition , which serve to reveal not only class difference in behaviour but also genuine feeling . this be why bratfisch be so important . without he there be no other character with who the	audience	can feel sympathy . ashton 's alain show yet another aspect of the sad clown or little man and can , when subtly play , gain much sympathy because , while thing seem to go right , he be so pleas with life . he delight first make it evident during he solo for lise even though technical mistake keep on happen .
ashton be alain show yet another aspect of the sad clown or little man and can , when subtly play , gain much sympathy because , while thing seem to go right , he be so pleas with life . he delight first make it evident during he solo for lise even though technical mistake keep on happen . when he pull he up or correct he placing or step he beam on the	audience	as , for example , when he finish with he back after a pirouette and hastily turn to face they . the same happen during the pa de deux that be suppose to be with lise . each time they arrive at a pose , cola somehow steal the expected kiss or hold lise in the proper climax as alain strike what he believe to be the proper pose .
man 's inhumanity to man the burrow ; a distant drummer it be important to note that this ballet be create by macmillan who aim have be to convince	audience	that dance in ballet belong to the reality of life and to show how life can be manipulate . he first descri this in noctambules which show how the character portray be manipulate by the hypnotist . manipulation be show very dramatically in a distant drummer .
yet ashton find way of so mould classical dance that the lady even dance sur le pointe in so edwardian a setting . the ballet could have be enter under the title of demi - caractre , but that people be not figment of the imagination . they really li , be visualise by the composer , then the choreographer and recognise by old friend in the	audience	. robbin dance at a gathering could be call a romantic ballet because it use classical technique coloure by natural emotional expression . it communicate the mood , sentiment and behaviour of young people meet to enjoy each other 's company as young people always do though not usually to chopin 's romantic music .
macmillan be the burrow , base on the real diary of anne frank , be possible the many explicit and move of all he effort to depict reality in term of dance ( see page 30 ) . the classification of today 's ballet become very difficult as they storie , theme and music get very complicated . very occasionally , the opposite happen , e.g . in robbin 's glass piece to john cage 's minimal music , the constant repetition of musical phras parallel by dance phras lose the interest of an	audience	bore with too much meaningless to - e and fro - e . modern style after study the above ballet it may well be ask what be modern style
as explain elsewhere classical technique be the much demand . it have evolve from the simple folk through the manner court and final to the expert classical dance . it be design to display both dancer and dance to the good advantage from the	audience	's point of view . it be a strict discipline upon which to build . it exponent be train to feel how to move with each part of they body and to know how they movement must be coordinate to produce one or another step or pose .
the enchanement can be dance to any time signature , phras or tempo . although some modern dancer do without music in the accept sense of that term , they rare do without rhythmic phras . if they do they have forget that , like they , every member of they	audience	have an inborn sense of measur time . . . without a sense of rhythm , we sense of time be devoid of landmark and , as frank howe add late , and sense ( see page 68 ) . the art of the particular
she display how to build live structure of pictorial importance by weave individual dancer or group deliberately and solemnly so that they frequently pause in a meaningful picture of distinctive shape . this be the full stop to a paragraph that give the audience an opportunity to sum up as it be how the bride 's hair be cut ; why the man convey the groom to the bride 's house ; how the bride and groom be bless by they parent ; and so on . by so phras each paragraph and bring each incident to a proper conclusion , nijinska give both dancer and	audience	time to consider what have be do and what be yet to happen . the nature of the formal shape make by the dancer 's body and limb as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluate . nijinska insist on the use of the pointe in order to emphasise the elongate portrait of the byzantine saint , thus the dancer 's body mostly face the audience but they arm and leg turn inwards and be see mostly in profile .
by so phrase each paragraph and bring each incident to a proper conclusion , nijinska give both dancer and audience time to consider what have be do and what be yet to happen . the nature of the formal shape make by the dancer 's body and limb as they move into and hold a picture must be evaluate . nijinska insist on the use of the pointe in order to emphasise the elongate portrait of the byzantine saint , thus the dancer 's body mostly face the	audience	but they arm and leg turn inwards and be see mostly in profile . the angle make at the elbow , shoulder , knee and ankle joint be clearly visible . that of the arm be particularly intereste because the fist be either clench or the finger flatten thus the line and shape make only appear slight round by the fold in the sleeve .
it be impossible exactly to define what be modern dance because the body be the same that have dance for hundred of year . choreographer cannot in any way change the way in which they dancer move . the	audience	recognise physical movement for it alone whereas that who theorise and attempt to define what they mean by such term as post or neo - modern , contemporary , avant - garde , etc . base they works on intellectual concept which need to be discuss in word . thus the audience fail to understand everything that be offer . dance be first a physical activity and if it be obscure by complicated costume , props , machinery , light and stage effect , it cease to be relevant to anything but the cleverness of the producer .

a pair of tramp in the cellar of an abandoned hotel lengthily air they psychological underwear until evict by a ( superficially ) heartless boilerman : we seem to have be here before . but there be not much pinter , and definitely no beckett , about this solid piece of middle - class music theatre by the canadian composer quenten doolittle , which begin it short british tour by the banff music theatre at the chapter art centre , cardiff . doolittle have base he on what seem a pellucid consequential and intelligently write play by rex deverell ( also the librettist ) ; and though the piece be offer as good suit to alternative	audience	, it cut an odd respectable figure in the modestly louche surrounding of chapter . two reasons strike i for this . first , the work be dramaturgically polite ; it consult it audience too much to be take serious as drop - out theatre .

the theatre royal , plymouth , be about to send a high commercial product into the west end . for elijah moshinsky , there be great advantage to start a show out of town . it seem to i that a new play like shadowlands need to be expose to different	audience	before it settle down . it be especially important in a play like this , which be such a delicate and sensitive piece of write , that the actor grow together as a cohesive group . i think that it be much easy to create that atmosphere in a good out - of - town theatre like plymouth rather than to prepare a star vehicle in a draughty rehearsal room somewhere in london .

what we be offer , if definition be need , might be call ballet - pantomime : it be certainly not opera . as in the good ballet - pantomime , the message be direct in origin and presentation . at time the method be decided crude , especially in a hint of west side story which conclude the overture , doubtless aim at today 's	audience	. oddly enough , ghanashyam ( a broken branch ) approach opera in the nature of the story it tell : originate in village festivity , the tale unfold a rake 's progress towards perdition , in this case via drug , but with an extra metaphysical twist when the spirit of the departed return to inhabit he wife . while the intention of the plot be clear enough , it be not significantly develop by the dance .

endesha ida ma holland , the author of this veile autobiography , be descri in the programme as a popular lecturer and story - teller : she work the same seam as maya angelou , toni morrison and alice walker ( who spiright she fulsomely invoke , and who book the color purple she implicitly recall at every turn ) . but holland 's particular trademark be a cute and cloy sentimentality , with pathos laid on thick . she story - tell have no obliqueness , no mystery ; everything be slowly and patiently explain , as though the	audience	be a fidgety bunch of six - year - old . the two director have do they well , speed the tale along on the wing of bessie smith and mouth - organ blue . and the actress they be a delight : josette bushell - mingo have an extraordinarily mobile face and an infectiously comic manner , joy richardson show an uncanny ability to get inside a 10 - year - old 's skin , and angela bruce , as the mother , have natural authority .

piecemeal highlight be all very well , but viewer tend to be creature of habit and , at present , a short burst of goal every saturday night be just a tease ; an uninitiate visitor would never guess that football be the national game . within itv 's rank , there be concern that last season 's gain have be waste . the overlord greg dyke , have pay a minimum of 11m a year for exclusive right to the league ( at the current rate of inflation , the four - year , index - link bill could soar over 50m ) , hit he	audience	target of eight million when manchester unite beat liverpool thrillingly on new year 's day . then come arsenal 's unforgettable finale at anfield in may , watch by nearly 12 million people ( much than the bbc get for the fa cup final ) . the viewer be hungry , one member of staff say .
before a demoralise defeat when challenge mike tyson for the world heavyweight championship two year ago biggs would have probably be too dangerous a proposition for mason but something have go from he since then and he be unable to fulfil bold pre - fight assertion . both man take heavy blow and by withstand the good of the american 's punch mason at little emphasise that he have a strong enough chin . it be not a contest to excite the	audience	and there must have be some anxiety in mason 's corner as it approach a critical stage . mason be ahead but biggs for a while look the strong man and employ he superior technique to suggest that mason might be run into trouble . he take four of six round and yet without ever make he supporter believe that a decisive victory be on the card .

it seem that even in it own time the thirteen - century motet be consider by many to be a sophisticate , subtle genre , only likely to appeal to the literati . that this generally complex , polytextual piece can today appeal to an almost capacity house at the wigmore hall be large due to two factor : the superb sing of gothic voice , and the ability of they director , christopher page , to unlock the musical secret of the past . over the year , page have establish he as a medieval raconteur , delight he audience with tale of , say , thirteen - century paris ; but anecdote aside , he have also be refin the presentation and programme so that , almost without realise it , he	audience	learn a good deal about the often totally unfamiliar music be perform . this concert , part of the early music centre festival , be one of the much overtly educative so far , with even , at one point , an illustrate guide to compose a motet in five easy stage . yet there be nothing condescendingly didactic in page 's manner , nor anything textbookish about gothic voice 's performance .

the range of sport programme , live and package , be extraordinary , while the videotape market be boom . no box match seem too trivial for live coverage , basketball and volleyball draw vast audience , formula one race grip the nation and there be an inexhaustible appetite for football , to the extent that saturday night english soccer be a major viewing habit . thus battle have be join between rai and the private channel for an	audience	which italian advertiser regard as pre - eminently desirable . according to giulio malgara , president of auditel , which monitor view habit , sport be the perfect medium for publicity . it guarantee record view figur in italy , much than film or variety show .

they cannot expect to affect the development of a genius like janacek . but that realisation should not be a disappointment : rather it liberate we from the job of create masterpiece , and give we a much much achievable task . that be quite simply to reduce by say 25 per cent the amount of time the eager opera	audience	wish to spend listen to famous old works about famous old people and place , and instead increase the amount of time it wish to spend listen to now works about ordinary people now . this be an exercise in persuasion , and require composer who will focus they art on the simple and fundamental act of communication with they enthusiastic but tired , inattentive , littrestle , distract and easy bore fellow human being who no the less long to hear they in a not necessarily flatter mirror of music . we society need to be give the chance to hear it own heartbeat in it own music for pleasure first , then also for knowledge and understand .
music / unholy row : cbso / rattle birmingham by jan smaczny the much appeal moment in mark - anthony turnage 's engage chatty introduction to three scream pope , he feeney commission premiere for the city of birmingham symphony orchestra at the birmingham town hall , come with a state desire that he music should be accessible to an	audience	. well , the pope , in terrify orchestral sonority , certainly screame and the new composition be , indeed , accessible to the audience . this substantial , 15 - minute orchestral movement be inspire by three painting of innocent x by francis bacon , they base on velasquez .

the confidence display by reformer such as mr nyer and imre pozsgay , who introduce the new party 's programme , be in sharp contrast to the air of resignation in the conservative row . karoly grosz , the outgoing general secretary , cut a lonely figure as he bow out , drop hint that in future he would be take a back seat in politics . mr grosz be the only senior politician yesterday with the courage to stand up for communism in front of a hostile	audience	. as a part shot , he even attacke reformist for resort to stalinist tactics and admit to have difference of philosophy and outlook with comrade poszgay . but mr poszgay 's radical programme look safe last night .

it seem unlikely that the east german leader feel much threaten by he tone . if anything , they may be relieve to have get off so light , give that east germany 's aversion to a local brand of perestroika and glasnost have long be clear . we do not doubt that the ( east german communist party ) be able through co - operation with all force in society to find answer to all that question which arise through the development of the republic and which inter it citizen , he tell the huge	audience	gather in the palace of the republic . mr gorbachev then warn against voice be raise in west germany demande the re - establishment of germany under it 1937 border . he say he do not idealise the european order , but until now , it be precisely the recognition of post - war reality that ensure peace in europe .
in he macbeth , the scottish warlord become a samurai warrior in 16th century japan , bludgeon he way to power beneath a cherry tree that rain white blossom down on he . medea , first perform at the edinburgh festival in the outdoor courtyard of the old college , end with medea in a chariot on the college roof , batter by the howle wind and rain . the	audience	, transport with she , sit open - mouth , oblivious to the rain pour down they neck . this time , though , ninagawa have bring over a japanese classic . suicide for love be adapt by matsuyo akimoto from three play by the 17th century writer chikamatsu monzaemon and ninagawa 's production involve 73 actor , a swirle snow storm and a river on stage the company , with true japanese courtesy , provide plastic mac for the first two row of spectator .

all the sign be that radio be an excit prospect the forthcom deregulation of the industry with associated change in cost , and an expect boom in advertise revenue , be final make the city take notice . the potential for an advertise bonanza have come under the spotlight with the advent of splitt frequency such as that undertake by london 's lbc last week . splitt frequency transmitt different programme on fm and be could effective double listen hour and provide two high targete	audience	for advertise in a catchment area . in lbc 's case , for example , the lbc crown fm be go for the upmarket listener , while the medium wave service , london talkback radio , be pitch for the tabloid market and the dedicate follower of phone - ins . capital radio , the other uk giant of the independent , have already splight it frequency , and before long all nine quote independent stations be expect do so , albeit not always around the clock .
be labour 's money man be never easy , even when the party be still in opposition and you be as persuasive as mr smith . but for once , the regular labour conference task of remind the party the public purse be not bottomless be put in the shade by the two loom tory conference task of presente the poll tax and 15 per cent base rate . the first of this be basically very difficult ; but mr patten have the advantage of novelty , the sheen of possible succession to mrs thatcher , a way with green word and blue	audience	. he be wrest much money out of the treasury to dilute the poll tax . but it be far from clear yet how much .
but it be far from clear yet how much . as for the hoped - for recast of the community charge , nothing short of transferr education to central government which be simply not go to happen before the next election can reduce it to a politically painless level . well , mr patten will do he good to make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear , and the	audience	will know it be not he idea . nor , of course , be it mr lawson 's . after a year in which the treasury 's forecast failure ( notable that very large trade deficit ) have be rather obvious , it be only fair to recall that it do presciently point out just about every awkward little detail of the poll tax , from it automatic upward impact on inflation to the folly of provide local authority with a golden opportunity to raise much tax while blame the government .

radio / no laugh matter by robert hanks comedian be suppose to work good with an	audience	. not alway though : witness the strange , sad case of arnold brown and company ( radio 4 , saturday ) , a series which slip neat into the bbc tradition of vague funny cabaret . much of arnold brown 's strength as a stand - up comedian lie in he eyebrow , a pair of fat black , hyperactive caterpillar .
i give he a real dressing - down . this be not a particularly good joke , but it be deliver neat . not a snigger to suggest that anybody in the	audience	even know this be a joke . the cheek , brown add . ( silence . )
the effect of this be , curious for a man who claim to have be eject from the library theatre in manchester for be overdue with he punchline , to slow thing down . brown be not a man with a big punch ; it be that tell body - blow that sap you opponent , plus some sly head - butt in the clinch . put he in the ring with an	audience	that you can not see , and he seem to be deliver butterf - tap . the law game ( radio 2 , tuesday ) also have an audience response problem , perhaps because the format be tired ; after all , it be in it fourteenth series . the way it work be this : shaw taylor introduce three short scene in which actor have row , go to industrial tribunal , issue death threat and so for .

there be times when this universe seem excessive , even arbitrarily , bleak . like peter brook 's endgame - inspire k lear in the sixty , this macbeth take the risk of narrow the play 's potential dramatic range in order to create a particular emphasis . limited scope exist for actor to develop individual character : there be little room , in particular , to explore tensions between the sympathy and horror that macbeth 's conflict can elicit in an	audience	. any loss in emotional or dramatic range , however , be generally compensate for by the fearsome intensity of the vision that result , and the compelle stylishness with which it be communicate . move , like the witch , with confident , implacable force , the citizen 's create a macbeth machine to assault a scottish audience 's expectation of this much familiar of shakespeare 's play , leave it , by the end , thorough drain and disturb .

( fn 23/11/87 , pp 234 ) then follow a story about the ineptitude of a young policeman in handle a domestic dispute , who be only rescue from he incompetence by a wise reserve man . the field - worker be a captive	audience	for tale like this , which be tell and retold by part - time reserve police in an attempt to cope with they marginality . a feature of such storie be they selectivity , for they omit to mention the number of part - time reserve police who be unemploy or in low - status employment , or who sign up for mercenary reason or for the power and respect that they believe accompany the uniform . but even tho who say they join in order to serve the community ( and there be many ) feel a disappointment upon enter the force as a result of the limit opportunity for this allow by they duty .
we need to distinguish between different medium source and also between the medium 's ability to inform and it ability to persuade . different element of the medium perform different functions . from what we know about they	audience	and they content , we would expect major difference between the influence of television and the influence of the press , and major difference also between the influence of highbrow and lowbrow source . if they have any influence at all , different medium source should influence they audience in different way . the expect influence of television
give that characteristics we should not expect bbc and itv viewer to be influence in different way . whatever influence television news have on voter , it would be likely to affect all , or nearly all voter . it would not affect different	audience	in different way . if we seek evidence of television 's influence , we should correlate general trend in public opinion with trend in the content of television news . moreover , despite it failing , british television be still very much an information medium rather than a propaganda medium .
in the middle of the spectrum , however , be perception with much than a hint of approval or disapproval implicit in they : perception of each party 's electoral chance ; perception of whether national economic performance and prospect be improve or decli ; and image of the party and party leader . it be not at all obvious whether view party leader as energetic or decisive be a perception or an attitude . to a foreign correspondent cover the british election for a foreign	audience	, whether a party leader appear energetic or decisive be simply a matter of objective report : a perception . to british voter , especially tho who identify strongly with a political party , energetic or decisive probably imply approval : for they , image be at the margin between perception and attitude . media influence on perception be likely to depend upon whether they be at the pure perception end of the spectrum or at the margin between perception and attitude .
this chapter use two technique to investigate media influence . to assess the impact of pervasive and consensual television news we can correlate trend in television news content and trend in overall public perception . to assess the impact of very differentiate media source we can look for difference between they different	audience	: difference between reader of highbrow or lowbrow paper , for example , or between reader of right - w and leave - w paper . the impact of a changing television consensus our analysis of television news content in chapter 4 show that controversy reach a peak on television in the third week of the campaign .
as ( 11 ) for itv news . note , however , that over three - quarter of that who watch itv news at any time have also watch bbc - tv news on the same day ; and over 90 per cent of that who watch itv news regularly also watch bbc - tv new regularly . approximately , therefore , itv news viewer be a subset of bbc - tv news viewer , not an alternative	audience	. watch itv news mean , in practice , watch much tv news . it be a long list , but the spssx stepwise procedure seldo select very than a few predictor as have a significant influence upon perception .
it would give the view freedom of choice , even if that freedo be not extend to the broadcaster . it might require public subsidy to political party to finance they own newspaper and television station . alternative , rival party could be give control of different public television station : so bbc 1 and channel 4 might become conservative - right w channel while bbc 2 and itv become socialist - left wing channel , which could then compete for an	audience	. the situation in some european country approximate that model . in britain the idea of open partisan broadcasting be pioneer by the scottish nationalist 's clandestine and illegal radio free scotland in the 1960 and very recently by southern sound , who use a discard former commercial radio band to set up they entire open and legal conference radio fm to cover the 1990 conservative party conference from an unashamedly pro - conservative viewpoint .
all they could imagine be that some new sort of tax be to be impose on they . they be relieve to find that this be not just another communist trick . how be the common lot of this	audience	change in 1922 the number of work hand have rise in the volost 's from 577 in 1917 to 872 now . this be mainly due to demobilization , but other may have be attract to the region due to the fact that through the expropriation of landowner , the area hold by peasant have go up by 65 per cent since 1917 .
for lack of sympathetic agent , the peasant be often leave to they own device in matter of general and even political culture . yakovlev observe that state publication for 1922 from gosizdat and krasnaia nov ' include nothing on agricultural and rural affair . how could the undilute work of kautsky and engel appeal to this	audience	at a time when even party member at low level rare understand the meaning of such concrete word as official , categorical , plenum , memorandum , or territory only five peasant in the whole of nikol 's skaium voluch ' have read any political or agricultural text . the mind of the other literate villager be dissipate on what they could pick up in a random manner : much of it naturally consist of religious tract , the traditional fodder leave over from the past .
it be think that anyone subscri to a newspaper would have to pay a special tax . among the wilder rumour in strong circulation be that lenin be dead , that the french have chose nichola as they tsar , and that england have declare war on russia , so there would be wholesale peasant mobilization once again . the distribution speed of oral rumour be much quicker than that of newspaper , which from the guberniium capital of voronezh ' shafy calculate to be one verst for every four and a half hours.the chief stumble block to a wide newspaper	audience	remain the high illiteracy rate . shafy make a detailed study of comprehension level by the supposed literate . a 27 - year - old party member and ex - red army man have read the press regularly since 1917 , but do not know the meaning of word such as class enemy , occupation , period , or many abbreviation , include the ussr .
in short , quite apart from economic or foreign policy consideration , the social momentum which have sustain the british throughout they difficult experience since 1945 be not be maintain . underlie this theme be the belief that the problem of the british system be be throw into stark relief by the littendle economic difficulty of the 1970 . the oxford economist , bacon and eltis , find a receptive	audience	across the political spectrum for they diagnosis that britain be generate far too few producer of wealth . in they stead come a new intermediate breed of service operative work in administration , in finance , or in the profession . university graduate become accountant , solicitor , or stock - broker instead of enter industry .
ramsey 's weight in debate rest upon much than he manner and he fluency and he command of word . he could be vehement in denunciation . on occasion marvellous phrase sprang out of he mouth and enthrall the	audience	. on off day he could sound tired , and sometimes excitement carry he away to an excess of length . he be not the clevere speaker in the house , a palm which by general consent go to the very tory charles smyth , and the house also contain patrick devlin and selwyn lloyd and sometimes rab butler .
he toure the village of cambridgeshire speak on behalf of the candidate , and speak in several hall of the town . at one village he be the only one of the appoint speaker to turn up . undismay , he hal an old man out of the	audience	, stick he in the chair , and then speak he for an hour and answer all the question . at another meet in the open air he speak from a cart and be tumble when a member of the proletariat tell the horse to gee up . he wrote michael ramsey 's monthly message for the cambridgeshire liberal magazine , which thereafter be scatter among the villager .
ramsey speak out about he faith for liberalism and talk eloquently about the freedom of liberal mind . he could say sentence which would have be preposterous if they be see as rhetoric but which he could carry because they be deliver with uproarious humour liberalism prolong one be youth , liberalism do not decay . the speech , observe benson , who think it remarkable , be rapturously receive by that huge	audience	. asquith be move . he rise to give thanks for the thank .
the contrast during the week of mission be so extraordinary as to affect ramsey 's life . in the three place of mission there be on aggregate some 2 , 500 member of the university every night of the week . temple talk rationally and effective in great st mary 's and hold he	audience	. norwood , despite thoughtfulness and humour , slowly lose adherent to the other two speaker . in holy trinity church nicholson abound in anecdote , vulgarity , rudeness , emotional appeal , a dogmatism so dogmatic as to fright .
frank do not conceal he regret . ramsey lose neither he sense of humour nor he power of mimicry when he become an ordinand . for party occasion he deliver a skit sermon call under the juniper tree which could reduce he	audience	to helpless laughter by it caricature of the much platitudinous and pontificat type of preaching . ramsey expect that once the resolution be take everything in the mind would be peace after doubt . he discover that this do not happen .
hoskyn , say one of the astringent colleague who disapprove of he , go to berlin and they muddle he mind and when he come back he could never get it unmuddle . hoskyn be not a good lecturer . at little , he lecture in such a way that many in the	audience	find he impossible to understand . this be one of the reason why bethune - baker , who think that everything obscure be woolly , regard he as useless if not bad for the young . student be know to spend they time in he lecture count up the number of clich which he use .
once the student , not without glee , watch he celebrat the sacrament with the end of he back brace protrud out of the top of he vestment . sometimes he could be observe wear some garment inside out . austin farrer come on a visit to lincoln and report that ramsey be a great man in the college and hold he	audience	spellbound and be less mad . from lincoln day descend a story which sound like ramsey - legend but the truth of which he confirm . an applicant for entry come to be interviewe .
the idea of become a monk vanish from ramsey 's heart . they announce the engagement in november 1941 . the morning it be announce a vast	audience	arrive for ramsey 's lecture and cheer he all the way up to the dais . he eyebrow twitch and he say , this week we be deal with the sixth chapter of st matthew whereupon 90 per cent of the audience tumble out of the room . they be marry on 8 april 1942 in the galilee chapel of durham cathedral .
so if you be not a uk taxpayer you be advise not to enter into deed of covenant , but to make you regular charitable payment by simple banker 's order without any covenant . you may in fact find that you do pay some tax in the uk . if you have dividend or receive	bank	or build society interest on which tax have be pay , tax will have be deduct at source , and this will enable you to sign a certificate of deduction of tax so that acet can obtain the advantage of covenant give . which spouse should enter into the covenant since 6 april 1990 , marry couple have be tax independently , and each spouse be responsible for pay tax on his/her own income .
if acet do somehow reclaim tax on the payment then you would be liable to pay income tax to the inland revenue on the amount of you gift aid payment . so if you be not a uk taxpayer you be advise not to make a payment under the gift aid scheme but to make a straight payment by cash or cheque . you may in fact find that you do pay some tax in the uk if you have dividend or receive	bank	or build society interest on which tax have be pay , tax will have bee deduct at source , and this will enable you to sign a certificate so that acet can obtain the advantage of the gift aid scheme . 8 . which spouse should make the gift aid payment

1986 ) . also , investment pattern in both part of ireland be increase similar , be a mixture of british , international , local , and cross - border companies . internal commerce , from heavy machinery to domestic good , large ignore the border , and the high street	bank	be the same throughout ireland . the main economic difference reflect the different structure of the state and the different state policy adopt by the british and irish government at any one time , though with a significantly high state sector of employment in ulster . there be likewise considerable overlap in cultural area .
often such scheme unashamed make vast concession to the demand of the modern pub customer . modern task light system be use to supplement the decorative fitting ; air condition duct be incorporate ; bottle display be refrigerate . this be not just fizzy lage joint , but environment where a	bank	of six beer engine can sit happy on the bar counter offer a wide selection of real ale . in the true tradition of the pub boom at the turn of the century , although decided grand , many of this refurbishment do not take they dead serious . the alabaster freize of monk with scatalogical latin inscription create by henry poole for the blackfriar in c.1905 come from the same tradition as the eclectic and irreverent use of ethnic imagery and architectural detail buil into the new horniman at hay galleria of 1986 .
be you an independent hotelier or restaurateur experience problem with you bank or perhaps you have a good relationship with you financial backer cater , in association with reed cater , be undertak a confidential telephone survey on the relationship between the	bank	and we industry , in preparation for a forthcom forum . face the financier . would you be prepare to contribute
at the end of the year , the finance company employ butler and patterson move to docklands and will merge all it uk office into one complex . butler and patterson will then manage a team of 70 staff for a clientele of 1,500 . ian lawrence , a high table head chef for a city	bank	, start work at eight in the morning and finish eight hour late . he work on a food cost budget of 5.50 per head for he top - floor staff restaurant , and 6.50 per head in the director 's private dining room . high table do not make a profit on he management of the ingredient budget it simply charge a management fee for the entire contract .
but roderick henderson , who run the chef division of recruitment consultant berkeley scott , do not believe that contract cater be always a financially reward sector in which to work . he estimate that an executive sous - chef work in a top london restaurant or hotel would be ear between 25 , 000 and 27 , 000 , whereas a head chef in contract cater at a director 's dining room , for example , would be do very well to earn 20,000 . brian watt , manage director of b . e . service , the in - house caterer at the bank of england , pay chef between 8, 000 and 17 , 000 per year , but the financial benefit of the	bank	's employee package ( cheap mortgage and pension , etc ) , bring this up to considerable very in real term . also , this be the basic rate of pay for a basic 35 - hour week , and generous overtime rate be pay for late - night and weekend work . watt have interviewed chefs who be work an average of 90 hour per week in the west end and ear about 14,000 .
what i find extraordinary be how each tree seem almost to suggest it own companion plan . on reflection , however , this may not be quite true , since anyone who set out to plant a wildlife garden instinctive take a much keener inter in , and be influence by , natural plant associations and community . in i own garden the twisted hazel , corylus avellana contorta , be underplant with primrose , bluebells and wood anemone , for that be how i remember they grow , as they still do , along the	bank	of the rive greta . it form a composition both nostalgically satisfy and harmoniously beautiful . i grow so many of i plant , include tree and shrub , from see .
they be poise with they edge on a north - south axis , hence it american name , the compass plant . just as fascinate be the relate s perfoliatum , another giant in which the upper pair of leaf unite at they base to form a cup - shape depression where , after rain , a little pool of water collect . both this plant be hardy and although not in the front rank of ornamental , be worth grow in a large border or even on the	bank	of a stream or lake provide they be keep away from the wet margin . inula magnifican also grow and look well by water , but be equally happy in the deep rich soil of a border or bed . it great clump of rough , hairy stem can grow up to 6ave tall .
much pilot have be show the effect of gross over - rudder during they basic training . the follow demonstration compare a stall with a little too much rudd to a stall in a slight slipp turn , and show how even slight too much rudder have a significant effect at the stall . start to circle in a normal turn with about 20 of	bank	, keep the yaw stre exactly in the middle while you reduce speed very gradually . ( on many type of training glider it will be possible to get down to the pre - stall buffet and continue with either a slight rock of the wing or a very gentle inner wingdrop . ) keep the rudder where it be and allow the speed to increase a few knot so that both you and the student can observe the exact position of the rudder pedal .
much beginner will find it difficult to apply the opposite rudder , because of they ingrained habit of use the stick and the rudder in co - ordination . it be also surprisingly difficult to hold accurate heade during a full airbrake sideslipp approach . you need to be familiar with the type of glider you be fly because each need slight different angle of	bank	and behave differently when side - slip . many type have a pot pitot in the nose and the asi indicate a false reading during side - slip . on some , the rudder overbalance bad and there be a bad trim change .
many type have a pot pitot in the nose and the asi indicate a false reading during side - slip . on some , the rudder overbalance bad and there be a bad trim change . much only need a small angle of	bank	, as the rudder on glider be not very powerful . normally you will want to use full side - slip for a few second rather than a small amount of slip for a much long time . provide that the need of slip be spot straight away , it should never be necessary to side - slip close to the ground .
provide that the need of slip be spot straight away , it should never be necessary to side - slip close to the ground . the slip be use just to get rid of the excess height so that less than full airbrake be require for the rest of the approach . with many glider , the easi way to enter a side - slip and to hold the heading be to freeze the rudder central while apply the	bank	. provide the approach path be correct beforehand , the adverse yaw as the aileron be apply swing the nose off to just about the right point to keep the glider on the correct path . the opposite rudder be then apply to hold that nose direction and to prevent the glider from turn .
provide the approach path be correct beforehand , the adverse yaw as the aileron be apply swing the nose off to just about the right point to keep the glider on the correct path . the opposite rudder be then apply to hold that nose direction and to prevent the glider from turn . much beginner apply the opposite rudder too harsh and this make it difficult to hold the	bank	constan . it be easi at first to limit the rudder movement to half or three quarter of the full deflection and to start by apply the bank movement just before apply the rudder . by all means practise side - slip at height , but do not assume that because you can do it at height you will be able to do it accurate on an approach .
attempt this in a gentle turn as well , and in a gentle turn with a little too much rudder . this time it will almost certainly drop a wing , but just ease forwards a little will make a recovery . try some very steep turn and then some with about 40 of	bank	; try reverse the turn quickly , and make little centr move . of course , if there be thermal about , do all this in the lift , provide there be no other glider share you thermal ! you should be able to go into turn and make centr movement without have to refer to the slip ball , yaw stre , or as i .
this be a matter of constantle explor out a few yard on almost every circle to try to find the good possible area of lift . frequently this involve turn steeply at low speed to keep the radius of turn to a minimum and to make use of the narrow core of lift . remember , thermal soaring be very about staie in the stron area of lift than fly at an efficient angle of	bank	; it usually pay to turn steeply , as the small turning circle enable you to keep in the narrow core of strong lift . if fly across country be not practical and you be local soar , it be good to practise move from cloud to cloud or thermal to thermal without take the climbs to any great height . for example , on a day with a 3000 foot cloud base , climb to 2500 foot on the first climb , then fly off leave that thermal , use the airbrake if necessary to come down to try to find another one at 2000 foot .
then do the same on an easterly or westerly heade . also try changing speed . you will discover large error fly near north or south with even small amount of	bank	, and large error on east and west if you vary the speed . compass error be an awful nuisance and it be well wor find out a little about they . you also need to become accustom to think and use degree , and decide whether you need to turn left or right to change the heading .
how do i raise the money i be to pay the amount that you be assess to pay be base on what you should be able to afford to take out as a loan . it may be that you choose to obtain a mortgage , second mortgage or a loan from a	bank	. if you feel that you will be unable to take out a loan in this way or that it will cause you financial hardship , you can apply to the social service department for help . they will ask you further information about you financ and/or you situation and may then in certain circumstance by able to offer you a loan .
one of i section in the subdivision be think of declare udi unilateral declaration of independence from the divisional headquarter as for headquarter and the force organizational structure , well that be just a joke as far as this man be concern . this rejection of a distant headquarter and enhancement of they own special identity occur some seven year after the last amalgamation . in that same year i be post to south shield on the south	bank	of the river tyne and quickly become aware that i have an enormous burden to carry , simply because i have spend all of i previous service on the other side of the river . at one point a uniform sergeant listen to i discuss some tactic , gloomily point out that i style be not they ; but then , he rationalize , how could it be , you be from the north side of the river . the emphatic denigration contain in this locational insult have to be hear to be understand , and in many way it parallel the dismissive tone use to deride the civvy , for nuance of speech and tone have immense mean to insider .

but they will not ask i . they do ask he , however , and they come in hundred for the purpose . he feel he have scarcely fall asleep , he be dreame of a black river , with no	bank	, yet there be something there , a source of light that he want to reach , which he could not reach against the cold drive of the current he wake in a sweat voice a dog bark . someone enter the room and he recognize allan stewart 's voice .
it have look like a melodrama a little group in a candle - light attic , hold up they arm with fist clench and swear to do or die . but they have mean it , and he be eager now to bring everybody together in a fine , hard point of resolve , in case zeal slacken and dy away in the holiday atmosphere of this soft , comfortable afternoon . the hill they look asleep , the heather glowe dust - blue in the hazy light , and the people , after a night of little sleep and hour of walk and stand , now look stun as they sit on the grassy	bank	, lean on dyke , or lie on they back in the hayfield , munch oatcake and drink the last of they water . some little group be go off to west and east , but much hang on with a sense that the next thing now demande to be do . cameron raise he right hand , clench he fist , and speak in a relax voice .
the river dream come to he again , he be wad deep into the current , it coldness gripe he by the crutch , shock he , he must reach that bluish hover light on the far bank tree tower above a house , a tall bulky building tower above he he half - wake , and see the window - square glimmer with the pallor of sunrise the river again , the far	bank	be near but here be a black smooth stretch , he half know that he be dream , he want to stop the dream and he want to get across , if only he could raise he mouth and nostril above the swell of the water he make he wake final and lie under the cover feel weak and hot , as though he have be spend energy incessantly all night . outside the day be fine enough , too clear perhaps ; each roughness on the skyline be sharply visible , as though it might rain late .
take it now , father , say mary , put down she basket and ease she shoulder . what be the use of die on the way to a wedding they all move off together down the tawny dust of the road , close beside the shingle	bank	and black deeps of the river . here it run between quiet green glade , the remnant of an oak wood which have be strip to build ship for the navy and then , in a last plundering , to make charcoal for the insatiable furnace and foundry down at carron forge . but here a thin frieze of very old tree have be preser for the delectation of the laird who look out from they house on the slope cluny , grandtully , clochfoldich , pitcastle .
zoology , the joker in he pack , offer in he final year , also achieve 62 per cent . perhaps the choice be he way of declare he consum inter in life , not learn , which be become an obsession . reader of the favourite game will remember breavman dissect a frog , which arise out of such early experience ; they will also remember he tear up an economic textbook outside a	bank	on sherbrooke street another reaction to the struggle and disinter he late recall . the choice he make , and the way he achievement oscillate , show a decided lack of conviction , or perhaps of direction , in he think . that the ability be there be beyond question .

the hero of kipling 's story be a london bank clerk who be also an ambitious poet . he name be charlie mear ; he be the only son of he mother who be a widow , and he li in the north of london , come into the city every day to work in a bank . the widowed mother , the residence in north london , and the daily travel to work in the london	bank	be all pad of eliot 's own experience at the time of the composition of many of the waste land . charlie 's business take he over london bridge . he poetic effort be mock by the narrator of the story , who be none the less fascinate by what stimulate charlie 's write .
he come to i time after time , as useless as a surcharged phonograph drunk on byron , shelley , or keat . yet charlie 's method also hint at the method which eliot would use in the waste land : the plastic mind of the	bank	- clerk have be overlay , colour , and distort by that which he have read , and the result as deliver be a confused tangle of other voice much like the mutter and hum through a city telephone in the busi part of the day . it be not only that charlie 's life , like that of tiresia , grow confuse ; he expression , speak out of modern london about remote and contemporary affair , all in a confused tangle of other voice , like a poetic ventriloquist , point in the direction of london bridge be fall down fall down falle down
forget the cry of gull , and the deep sea swell and the profit and loss . overwhelm by water , charlie mear , the london	bank	- clerkcum - greek - galley - slave meet he death by water much than once . i have an awful dream about that galley of our . i dream i be drown
this vision , what eliot call kipling 's knowledge of the thing which be underneath , and of the thing which be beyond the frontier , , be what make some of kipling 's short story so important to the write of the waste land . it be like frazer 's look into the abysm of time , but it be a vision only imperfect appreciate by charlie mear , as the narrator of the fin story in the world emphasize : above all , he be absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sell to i for five pound ; and he would retain that ignorance , for bank - clerk do not understand metempsychosis , and a sound commercial education do not include greek . to find it much last realization , charlie 's vision would have to wait for a bank clerk who do understand metempsychosis , and who have not only a commercial education gain in an underground room at lloyds	bank	, but also a knowledge of greek . the waste land 's tone would be grimmer , throb between two life . but when such a bank clerk follow charlie , rudyard kipling enter the waste land .
if there be to be an escape , it be to lie not in the damp gust bring rain but in shantih as the buddhist 's pass beyond the cycle of creation . eliot be unable to renounce the world he know . he remain with vivienne , the	bank	, and year of exhaustion in which he come close to death . he decide eventually that to embrace buddhism would be to plunge into a world too cultural alien . in the time follow the waste land he see the world despairingly , in term of inane , savage horror .
that same year he worry over slum area concern about overcrowd and the possible creation of new slums . but it be the city 's spiritual health which much preoccupy he , though he realize spiritual and economic be not always inseparable . in a paragraph who subtitle , city , city , hark back to the waste land , he express astonishment that in an economic slump the city be pull down building to erect ever very splendo	bank	. eliot be fond of familiar detail of a london which , in a sense , he have know all he life , ever since the childhood reade of sherlock holmes which he recall in 1929 . it be he own spiritual change which make possible after the poem of the early twenty a much affectionate view of london , but we should not assume that the owner of down the silver stream of thames have ever be totally blind to the beauty of the city .
once through , we really cut loose . this bit of park have just enough hint of wilderness to be readily transform in imagination into prairie , canyon , rain forest , river delta , open sea . we hinterland of the imaginary actual consist of grass tussock , bramble , a grove of willow , some hawthorn , a beech tree or two , drainage ditch , a slow and deep brook with steep	bank	, a weir , twin tunnel which take the stream beneath the main derby to nottingham road and , upstream , a wooden footbridge and wobble step stone . all in all , the perfect showcase for a new identity as hero . i recall imitat a stunt perform by the obscure buffalo bill jnr in a poverty kow serial , when he outwit he pursuer by swing at speed from saddle into tree .

there be a memorable description of they part : when , on the third morning i look for athman to say goodbye to he , he be nowhere to be find and i have to leave without see he again . i could not understand he absence ; but sudden , as i sit in the speed train , a long way already from el katara , i catch sight of he white burnous on the	bank	of the oued . he be sit there with he head in he hand ; he do not rise when the train pass ; he make no movement ; he do not give a glance at the sign i make he ; and for a long time as the train be carry i away , i watch he little motionless , grief - stricken figure , lose in the desert , an image of i own despair .

it have many difficulty in controlle m3 , which prove to be an unreliable barometer . an influential report by professor jurg niehan in february 1981 argue that monetary policy be in fact excessive tight because the high intere rate be attract foreign money to london and maintain a high pound . difficulty in exercise control be also increase by the civil service dispute during 1980 and the increase in	bank	lend for mortgage . another measure , of narrow money , be mo , which cover cash , the bank 's till money , and the bank of england 's operational cash , and the chancellor set a target for this as well . table 8.3 show that the government regularly exceed it monetary target .

in spite of complaint by business about the pound 's appreciation ( in may 1979 it effective exchange rate be 81.3 per cent and in january 1982 it be 92 per cent of it 1975 rate ) the government come to rely on a strong pound as part of it anti - inflation strategy . contrary to declaration that there be no government policy for sterl and that it would be leave to the market to decide , by late 1981 the government interven to reverse a fall in the exchange rate , and raise base rate to 16 per cent . it do the same again in january 1985 ; when the pound fall to 1.12	bank	be instruct to raise intere rate by 1.5 per cent . the record high intere rate be attractive to holder of sterl even though they be also damage to business . the exchange rate policy be high damage to manufactur .
he be make a freeman of the city of birmingham in 1982 . sir adrian cadbury be not one of that who subscribe to the popular theory that a truly professional manage can take over the helm of any type of business with only a superficial knowledge of the nut and bolt . i be very sceptical of the ability to shift from manage a	bank	to manage a steel mill , for example . i have grave doubt about that . i think it be essential to understand the key factor for success or failure in you type of business and i be not convince you can do that without actual understand the process in some detail .
when you be in a defence industry that be inevitable . there be fundamental difference between this two government department between two minister and westland be piggy - in - the - middle , which be a very cost and unfortunate experience . the important issue for i as chairman throughout that period be to remember that once the prime minister have say that westland be a private - sector problem which must be solve by private - sector measure and technique , one be interest be obviously the shareholder , the employee , the customer and the	bank	, since the company be heavily indebt . one be not then justify in think and function in terms of what might be in the national interest , what might ultimately be a desirable development for nato strategy or defence strategy . it be rather a very specific and harsher problem which , to put it bluntly , be to survive as westland be drift on to the rock of insolvency .
what be intereste about that be that at the time john brown get into financial difficulty the bank and institutional shareholder take a tough but very constructive view that it be worth help the company through a reconstruction rather than force it into liquidation , which have be an attitude prevalend some year early . it be in fact i experience of work with the bank and institution for the recapitalisation and reconstruction of john brown which lead i to think that the city be much malign over it attitude to industry and the accusation of short - termism be not justify . the institution and	bank	have be immensely supportive in help save the company . when i be approach over westland , it be by some of the bank and institution that have be involve in the john brown affair . one of i reason for become involve in westland be that i feel in some respect that i owe they something .
the japanese be come in through big bang . we be small . if you take the large ten bank in the world , there be not a single british	bank	among they . the first bank that come into the rating be natwest or barclay at number fifteen . finniston be these be that the creation of wealth should come before the creation of employment ,
we be small . if you take the large ten bank in the world , there be not a single british bank among they . the first	bank	that come into the rating be natwest or barclay at number fifteen . finniston be these be that the creation of wealth should come before the creation of employment , because it be the creation of wealth that create employment , not in the thing that be create the wealth but in other thing .
in he esso day he be invite to join the board of william glyn . he find that it opened a window on the city that he would otherwise never have have . it mean he could go and talk to the governor of the bank of england and the chairman of any of the clearing	bank	whenever he feel the need . when he be approach to run british aerospace the government insist he should give up the directorship of wg , but pearce , display he usual resolve , would not hear of it . he feel the contact be so invaluable that he be prepare to turn down the job at the head of one of the uk 's premier blue - chip company if it mean make such a sacrifice .
the gap between the willingness to lend and the capacity to receive be partly due to the fact that the majority of donor have country lend , or grant , target . the staff member they deploy in the field to identify project be under pressure from they senior management to turn such target into reality . worke within an embassy office or the regional office of a multilateral	bank	it be not difficult for donor 's staff to come up with a list of potential project which can be present to a recipient country 's ministry of finance for discussion . overwork official in finance ministry rare reject a whole list of potential project ; they be much very likely to identify a few priority at random , and pass on the donor to the line ministry , hope for the good if and when the project be financ . once a project be on a donor 's priority list it take on a life of it own , and may become unstoppable .
then it begin to get easy . we have not to hide any long . one hot day i remember leave gun and clothes along the river	bank	and swimm without a stitch on . another sunday we go troll , drag an otter behind the boat . then they try to bring in the general .

for instance , the frost level be critical . apart from the brief cold spell in late november , we have have very few hard frost . this be good news , because now water level all over the country be rise so fast , it mean the	bank	will be spar from the scour effect of a hard winter . this be also good for fly life in the com season , all that egg be now safely under a protect layer of water . prolong cold spell on reasonable full lake be not a bad thing .
few lake or reservoir start to warm up until late march , and the deeper one be normal cold well into may . the shallow bay may be a degree or two warmer , and be always the first place to look in the early day , but the deep will stay cold until real strength return to the sun . fish normally seek out the warm shallow , and if there be a few day of sunshine before open day then you will know where to choose on the	bank	. at the moment , many reservoir be fill fast . in november and december last year the water table across the land be deplet , but the majority have now be replenish .
i predict with some confidence that chew and blagdon will be at top level for the start of the 1991 angle year . the newly - flooded margin will be attractive to the fish in the first few day , until the sudden influx of size ten wader make they wary . the great thing about have the lake at top level be there be so much	bank	to choose from , and we be almost spoild for choice . this be not the case when the level be even just a few foot down . for i money it can rain as much as it like in the com week .

perhaps we go and take a look sure , anything be good than manhandl the sledge through waist - deep snow . the lake have be sweep clean of snow by the wind , the sweeping make a huge	bank	on we side that we have to negotiate . it be top by a wind - blown crust that almost hold we weight as we descend . the ride across the lake give we we well sledge for day , but the search for the ruin be litthopele , an endless toing and fro among tree and too - deep snow .

cricket , the game of the british amateur par excellence , be now sponsore by tobacco firm and insurance company whilst footballer advertise everything from double - glaze to guinness on they shirts . the football league be recently sponsore by a japanese camera manufacturer who name have to be repeat when publish or broadcast result . a newspaper and now a	bank	have since take over . in return for medium coverage and the clean image of sport , sponsor be prepare to provide big injection of cash . this new rush to make profit from sport provide a contemporary context against which to measure the early degree of commercialization .
only six out of sixty - two lead club pay they shareholder any dividend in the season 19089 and they be restrict by the fa from pay a dividend of much than 5 per cent . no one who be out for a business return would look at football share , comment a leading sport paper . hundred of shareholder have for year maintained guarantee at	bank	, continue the article , and thousand have help to create club by take share without hope of see they money back or any return on it . the same be broad true of scotland . only ranger and celtic make much money hence the original meaning of the term the old firm and celtic be pledge to donate to catholic charity .

within a few minute all the rig have arrive and splash in , and the early arrival which have form two - and three - rig raft be crab across the river and push upstream to the bridge centreline . the crane ratchet of the late arrival could still be hear clearly as they crew outramp , and rise bow wave could be spot as an occasional laggard power upstream to it proper place in the echelon . both the two - rig landing bay have move into the bank on the centreline , and they combined crew , assist by the ubiquitous	bank	support section , have connect the anchor rope and the short ramp section , which be add to the main ramp to allow traffic easy access to the bridge . the troop staff sergeant detail to supervise the construction be insistently call the raft into the head of the bridge , where they coupl on with remarkable rapidity . the end of the bridge be clearly visible as it grow out of the far bank , and need only a couple of raft to make it complete .
the cordon be eventually lift at 1900 hour and the section flown home , only to prepare for a very full day 's patroll on the follow day . the day 's miss training would have to be fit in some other time . in belfast , the day start on a humorous note when , at 0130 hour , the top cover sentry of a mobile patrol from one of the companies of 7th/ 10th ( city of belfast ) battalion notice that the front door of a	bank	be wide open . the patrol dismount from they vehicle and , have inform the battalion operation room of they find , deploy around the bank to await the arrival of the ruc . as the patrol commander approach the door of the bank , he spot a black briefcase lean against a wall .

the patrol give cover as the police approach the building . just at that moment a man staggere out of the door of the bank ; when he see the tableau of police and soldier in front of he , he throw he arm up in the air . the ruc sergeant go forward and arrest the man , who turn out to be the	bank	security guard who be rather the worse for drink , and have forget to lock the door ! the whole incident be over within an hour and the patrol be able to return to they base . south - east of belfast lie rural county down , the tactical area of responsibility of 3 udr .
the flesh it out theatre company from east london be do a show at the edinburgh festival on behalf of amnesty . mum in human right a new mum	degree	in human right be be offer by the university of essex . unique in the uk , and probably in the world , the ma be a one - year course begin in october 1991 . it be intended both for that who want to do practical or legal work for human right organization , and for that who would find it an outstand preparation for research degree in law , philosophy and politics .
a new mum degree in human right be be offer by the university of essex . unique in the uk , and probably in the world , the ma be a one - year course begin in october 1991 . it be intended both for that who want to do practical or legal work for human right organization , and for that who would find it an outstand preparation for research	degree	in law , philosophy and politics . good card in the biz amnesty have be give greetings magazine 's good charity card of the year award .
academy of art , whether in the west or in the orient , have have list of priority in theme of art , in which there be many similarity . for example , in twelfth - century china , a catalogue of the imperial collection have ten heading : taoist and buddhist subject , human affair , palace and other building , foreign tribe , dragon and fish , landscape , animal , flower and bird , ink bamboo , and final vegetable and fruit . this sort of lis be worth know by a reader , who may occasionally notice that it underlie the	degree	of attention be pay to a theme by a critic . the survey with a theory the last type of survey to be consider have a basis in theory .
commemorative figure in city square , portrait bust , tomb or cemetery furniture have also be traditionally restrict by the term of commission . a consequence of this tradition be that the sculptor 's own personality may receive less prominence in a monograph than a painter 's , as the effect of patronage given or withheld can be decisive in a sculptor 's career . the other major role of the sculptor be in the service of religion , where a high	degree	of interplay between artist and patron be not necessary so important , make the sculptor 's situation into one which be much like the painter 's . write on auguste rodin can make the point . according to george heard hamilton , rodin become a figure of international significance , the much admired , prolific , and influential sculptor since bernini .
part of the reason for this be that the american professoriat be the large in the world , while the american market for current art be unprecedent ; it be evident that the turnover of the american art market as a whole be the large in the world . the persuasive tax advantage for the rich to contribute works of art to public collection also play a part , contribute a measure of prestige share between artist and the powerful in society . critic can also be invest with a	degree	of respect derive partly from they academic connection . another sort of authority derive from money , which a reader of art criticism may find it difficult to dissociate from an object . historical knowledge be the sure cure for this damaged intellectual condition , as the history of taste will show many example of the irrelevance of monetary value to artistic quality .
this african have not move into the house of the portuguese . they be passive , we be tell ; moral scruple do not come into it . kapuscinski generalise : the	degree	of consciousness that drive one to demand justice or do something about obtain it have not yet be reach . from benguela , kapuscinski and a film crew travel to a scene of carnage , guide by carlotta , a heroine of the mpla . when the european decide to return , they guide decide to stay , and be immediately kill .
remember that there may be some twelve to eighteen plac at any one of the drama school , and the number of audition may number up to fifteen hundred for the lead school . do not be daunt by that , but recognise that like everything else in the act business , it be high competitive . no drama school panel be look for the ultimate in audition technique but candidate should possess a noticeable	degree	of competence and self - awareness . not all audition have just two speeche , classical and modern . you may well be ask to se something unaccompany , or do a short improvisation and you may well be ask to perform one of the speech in a different way .
if you have do any class work before attempt the drama school audition , much of the teacher will at some point in they session have talk about relaxation . a lot have to do with how you breathe and how you react physically to moments of tension . you will be tense at the audition because a lot be at stake , but if you trust to you own natural resource , the	degree	of panic can be reduce . i would suggest that if you be sure of you piece , do not read they over and over again on the way to the audition once will be quite enough . nerve afflict everyone in some way , and without they act would be the poorer .
press notice be , however , exceptional rare this day . once the stage cover all finals production from the drama school , but now they may write up a play perhaps once a year . this be a pity , as it mean that student find it hard to get they name know , and it mean they lose out on a	degree	of publicity . the private tutorial in the last term of the diploma course student often find tutorial , where they be give opportunity to talk about work in progress , enormously valuable .
in the south , the marginality of the third main political party , the irish labour party , be an indication of just how successful the articulation of capitalism to religious and national belief be . the south be not a classless society , but it class nature have be well hide in consciousness and dominate by the procedure of the capitalist - democratic process . despite the principal duality of irish party political power , the bourgeois structure of the state have rare be question , only the	degree	of state intervention in the bourgeois economy . also , the clerical church have be particularly antipathetic to socialism in any form . it show it to have a horror of socialism already in the nineteen century .
the religious component of catholic nationalism there be nothing theoretically which hinder religion be an ingredient , or even predominat in the nationalist mix . roman catholicism and protestantism constitute , in different way and to vary	degree	, nationalist and loyalist belief in ireland . this be even official in the case of loyalism . in the case of irish nationalism a specific relationship with catholicism have be formulate .
catholic morality approf of the view that to repel an aggressor be to engage in a just war . it just so happen that irish national popular consciousness interpret the presence of the british state in ireland as a form of aggression and hence feel justify in repell the british from ireland . catholic morality also approve of a proportionate	degree	of violence to overthrow tyranny . many irish catholic nationalist also consider the british and they orange ally to have establish tyrannical government in a part of ireland . therefore they find it just to overthrow the northern statelet by whatever degree of force prove necessary .
catholic morality also approve of a proportionate degree of violence to overthrow tyranny . many irish catholic nationalist also consider the british and they orange ally to have establish tyrannical government in a part of ireland . therefore they find it just to overthrow the northern statelet by whatever	degree	of force prove necessary . of course , some belief in violence be unrelated to catholic moral teach . some irish nationalist hold that it be just to unite the nation by force a typical view of secular nationalism throughout the nineteen and twenty century in europe .
a dislike by irish clerics for such an explicit and direct church state relationship have a long tradition and come out well in de tocqueville 's ( 1957 ) conversation with irish clergy on he visit to ireland in 1834 . when ask if they would like subvention from the state to aid they stipend and church building , a move which be be serious consider by the british government at the time , priest and bishop be unite in reject the idea on the ground that it would drive a wedge between clergy and people , identify clergy with the principal enemy of the people . de tocqueville 's note reveal not only the conscious opposition to such a mode of religious power but also how deep the solidarity between clergy and people be , the	degree	to which the poor , half the catholic population at the time , look to the clergy for material and spiritual leadership , guidance , and assistance , and how much they trust they . however , with the emergence of the southern irish state , it soon become clear that this secularization of the state form be not to signify an absence of roman catholic power in the construction of public morality , but rather an indirect recognition of the sovereignty of the church in many area of moral concern besides education . in fact , precisele because roman catholic power be to be accept as normative in an entire natural way by the catholic nationalist population , the church 's part - active and part - passive acceptance of the capitalist system of government and thorough opposition to socialism have a significant legitimat function for the irish state - form .
this monopoly position be therefore totally beyond criticism . one might speculate that an impend solution to the northern ireland problem would splight off from the clerical leadership that group for who the present position be only accept on pragmatic ground . hence the traditional alliance between catholicism and nationalism might be splight at the popular basis with the ensuing growth of a	degree	of anti - clericalism . however , as the very existence of the catholic nationalist alliance impedes progress towards such a solution , one should perhaps view such a possibility as unreal . the roman catholic leadership in ireland have first to change and radical evaluate it monopoly beliefs , thus permitt the dissolution of one of the much antagonistic aspect of catholic nationalist hegemony .
some catholic nationalist in the south mix with a proportionally much large number of southern protestant who , however , be loyal to the southern state . part of the reason why roman catholic go to they own school be because they believe they be oblige to do so . the belief be to some	degree	affect by be tell so by they authoritative pastor . it have even be descri as a fundamental moral precept by much than one irish catholic cleric : the law of the church be quite definite , quite universal in this matter . it be that there be an obligation to go to catholic school
the pressure to remodel old pub be of course nothing new . the victorian and edwardian era witness many wholesale rebuilding of modest georgian drink - house ; during the interwar period even much money be pump into enlarge and rebuild old pub , as well as in create large new one ( see alan power 's essay below ) . however , alteration be very often than not effecte with some	degree	of sympathy for the exist fabric and atmosphere . with the advent of postwar modernism much of this sympathy evaporate . the ascetic modernist 's rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave new world be clearly incompatible with the historic pub .
both this establishment seem to have have an architectural form very similar to the ordinary domestic building of they area , and the hall provide the communal eat and drink space . the tavern be a meet place , usually in the centre of the town or village , where wine be normal serve . according to john earle , write in 1628 , the inn be a superior establishment to the alehouse and be a	degree	or ( if you will ) a pair of stair above an alehouse , where man be drunk with much credit and apology . the alehouse in it many basic form be simply a domestic building where ale be sell to generate additional income for the household , although david lupton observe in 1632 that the alehouse keeper defy a wine tavern as an upstart outlandish fellow , and suspect the wine to be poison . she ale , if new , look like a misty morning , all thick .
arguable brewer be still as constrain by the profit motive as ever before . this may lead to the destruction of far historic pub which be consider redundant ; conversely , this may well lead to the further restoration and conservation of the good historic site . it may be an unpalatable think , but we suspect that to an increasing	degree	throughout the 1990s brewer and conservationist will find they stand on the same side of the fence . the antelope pub in london 's belgravium ; langford and william 's refurbishment of the exterior .

about 4 , 600 people in britain have contract aids , of who half have die , compare with about 600 four year ago . in addition , there be 15 , 000 people know to be hiv - positive and twice as many believe to be carry the virus without requeste medical help . but mr davie say : we have have case of people who we have suspecte of be infect and the	degree	of compassion and humanity among other staff have be remarkable . phil philip , deputy secretary of the british hotel , restaurant and caterer association , say : people in the industry be much good educat about aids than they be in 1987 . many within the industry admit private , however , that they may be less inclin to appoint someone who declare they infection at they interview .
it should make a lovely display against black beauty , another very distinctive pansy . double daisy be often overlook , but we be plan for a really fresh new look from mix bellis habenera . it flower have needle - thin petal in differ	degree	of white , rose , pink and carmine . wallflower , particularly blood - red or the salmon - red of eastern queen , be favourite in the north . we always tell folk to watch out for clubroot , because the wallflower be actual a member of the cabbage family .
light in some form be absolutely essential for the healthy development of green plant . all the complex chemical change that take place within every leaf be fuel by the energy in light , and regulate by the intensity and duration of the light available . but some plant actual prefer vary	degree	of shade , which be fortunate for gardener choose plant for gloomy corner or the dapple shade beneath tree . gardener occasionally regard shade as an evil to be avoid at all cost . it can certainly cause problem with a wide range of plant , but there be many other that suffer from high intensity of sunlight .
you will discover large error fly near north or south with even small amount of bank , and large error on east and west if you vary the speed . compass error be an awful nuisance and it be well wor find out a little about they . you also need to become accustom to think and use	degree	, and decide whether you need to turn left or right to change the heading . the easy way to remember it be that for a less number of degree , you turn left , e.g . turn from 350 to 320 be turn to a less number and therefore you turn left . turn point photography
it exist large as a product of the institution of high education ( sarsby 1984 : 132 ) and have only recently begin to surface in policy and practice . as okely ( 1987 : 67 ) observe , the urge to create publication be not always as crucial to other as it be to the academic . indeed for that insider live in cheater 's metaphorical front room such as in the police the need to obscure and seek a	degree	of anonymity from the analytic gaze can be descri as a major principle in the preservation of power , rank high in the structure of significance . yet there be that of we who , although firmly base inside such an institution , have undertaken anthropological training and have subsequently develope the academic wish to be discursive . we interpretation of the field situation therefore become a specific and unusual type of anthropology at home , for it be not out there in the exotic or even in the backyard .
s.u . be to be encoura , eliminate chain of assessment and decision make which have lain within the purview of the superintendent . a central decision make process involve inspectors and civilian decision maker be establish and develope . it early implementation meet with a	degree	of resistance , for the new system fundamentally dislocate the well establish and cultural preference of the service . inspectors can no long hide behind a paper manage a desk ( quote from a chief superintendent ) . then again for reason of establish cultural preference we have to go back to the audit commission and ask they to translate 6.358 million into real man , for we have difficulty in try to sell such an alien concept to the police mind .
he descri the study of precedent and case law as be real academic activity for police officer , thus support i contention that research into the philosophy of control be unreal or pollut . he speak revealingly about the problem he have have with jurisprudence , bemoan the fact that it be ambivalent and undefin , concern primarily with the ambiguity which sustain the anthropologist by reveal the centrality of a system : it be all grey area ; no black and white certaintie or decision ; no precedent or case law give the definitive interpretation . at the police staff college shortly before i be offer the scholarship to university , i have listen as list of	degree	obtain by previous scholar be read out . the majority be for law and be greet by applause in an assemb of the staff and student . later on , however , the name of that who have graduate in the social science and especially sociology be greet with hiss disparagement and barely conceal denigration .
he must come to term with living with this consciousness and with the inherent problem he will face in reveal this knowledge to the outside in an ethnographic account . moreover , he must come to terms with a new awareness of what he have previously accept , perhaps without think , which under the intense microscope of social enquiry may well seem to verge on the ludicrous or to be morally indefensible . and have long be support by the institution he will be crucially aware that it expect a	degree	of loyalty verge on deference or acquiescence . in such an archetypal world , where good be constant and insecure balance in an eternal struggle against evil , the objective explication of the ritual and symbol which surround and mystify police work can seem tantamount to a treasonable act . in 1979 , james anderton , the christian moralist chief constable of great manchester , descri the great threat to lee and order as stemm from seditionist interested group who do not have the well - be of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy ( thompson 1979 : 380 ) .
it would be paradoxical for they to be in the vanguard of social change , for as templeton ( 1980 ) point out , they be there to preserve the structure ; to uphold the state of play . but there be a few who be question the state of play , and who agree with ben whitaker ( 1979 : 312 ) when he ur that police think would profit if it very often come out of it shell and concern it with wide question about the role of the police and human relation . however , this be not always easy to achieve , as i find out when i first return to work in 1977 after i	degree	course . in order to continue postgraduate study i have apply for some financial assistance for part - time fee , under a scheme create by the home office and set up specifically in recognition of a lack of high educational qualification in the police service ( ho circular 29/74 ) . this directive encourag officer to research and study in they own time and list suitable subject , which include public administration , management study , economic , law , criminology , social science , youth work , english language and literature and relevant modern language .
this directive encourag officer to research and study in they own time and list suitable subject , which include public administration , management study , economic , law , criminology , social science , youth work , english language and literature and relevant modern language . the circular go on to point out that the list be not exhaustive and suggest other cours may be appropriate . i have apply to continue full - time research follow i	degree	course , but this have be turn down by i chief officer ; however , i have be tell that assistance for part - time study would almost certainly be appro in view of the national policy of encourag officer to extend they educational qualification . i then find i application for financial assistance for part - time study have be reject because anthropology be not on the approved list of subject ( in the circular ) ( memo from hq 1977 ) . eventually i be able to convince i senior officer that anthropology be one of the social science , perhaps only because i somewhat sardonically return a memo which ask why , if anthropology be not appro , have i just be allow to read the subject on a bramshill scholarship , on full pay and allowance
another inspector from merseyside , read social study at liverpool , say : i feel isolat , not just ignore , but socially dead ( personal communication ) . smith ( ibid . 157 ) also touch on the crucial feeling of potentiality which the university experience can produce in the individual , but which the police be general unable to incorporate . yet another inspector return to leicester with a	degree	in psychology be set to work in the force vehicle store count tyre . like many graduate stimulate by they experience , he discover that although he have be of sufficient calibre to acquire the offer of the scholarship in the first place , he now face the inevitable service obsession with a rejection of academic prowess in preference for practical skills in the real world ( ibid . 157 ) : the great problem with the current work of the scheme appear to relate to re - entry into the service
it would , of course , have reveal some aspect of the variable world of police culture to the outside and this be unacceptable . another writer on the police meet similar problem when he wish to write and publish . i have discuss the problem of inside analysis with he at a 1988 police conference , where he descri how , on return to he force after he undergraduate	degree	, he have ask for permission to publish research material . he request be refuse in a write memo from hq , but no reason be give . unwill to accept this constraint , he go on to ask why not ( again in write report ) and be informed reason be never give ; the official line be simply to refuse all such request .
indeed , the fact that he have apparently use an editor from a manchester newspaper for some of he purpose be latch onto and quote as a sign that he be suspect and disloyal . one consequence of this mode of think be that the service have to live out a continuous and enormous paradox . even at the same time as it public commend high education , seek out the graduate entrant , spend large sum on publicity to this end , and fund access to	degree	course on scholarship , it also hold to a central ethic of distrust of the academic . whitaker ( 1979 : 229 ) clearly understand the way this rejection of training and education operate within the service : at present good recruit often have to be chase to bramshill on the lengthy command cours , because chief constable be not anxious to spare able man , and officer they be reluctant to be separat from they family and home , as well as have a fear that they might lose from be out of sight , out of mind for promotion .
furthermore , such pressure be limit , thus create a situation where there have be hardly any research on the police compare with the large output of critical scholarship on industry , commerce , the civil service , the health service and education what little direct research there have be on the police have scarcely begin to ask such fundamental question as what be the police force and what be it do . this point ( wojta 1982 ) occur in a description of a new research centre for police study at strathclyde university , which be to ask whether anyone be do research on the police , what	degree	of co - operation they have meet and to encourage research by the police they . once again , however , defensiveness win the day and when the strathclyde centre circulate force ask they to co - operate in the venture , a decision be take to withhold co - operation and a circular go round to this effect , suggest the exist home office fund prsu ( police research service unit ) and the home office research and plan unit be adequate for the need of the service . this latter unit ( former the ho research unit ) do provide some research material for that who seek it out and it bulletin be a reference source to recend government fund research , which be large concern with operational system and the tool of policing .
the conference be also tell that as an alternative to the expense of send officer to university , it be propose to direct officer to research a particular problem and give they a short period to carry out intensive research . the emphasis on directed research be i and indicate the reduce potential for any ethnographic sedition , for which force would seek to direct officer to the critical analysis of it subcultural idiosyncrasy furthermore , such short period of direct research can be show favourable as a save over any extend	degree	course in the budget . the emphasis of this directed ( or control ) research , it be announce , be to be on pragmatic , problem - solve enquiry ( i.e . policy - orientate research ) , which , it be explain , would be of cost - effective advantage to the force . there seem to be little chance of any philosophical , unprogrammatic enquiry here which might be critical of the system ; and no espionage from within !
it be the marker of force and hence continue to sustain the continuing paradox of police force police service which remain unresolve , on which i will say very late in relation to the role of woman police officer . the dark uniform we wear have a military cap with polish brim , and in we fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boot we present an avenge image , cloth in the symbolic colour of death and darkness . black be a light absorbent , non - reflective colour and much suitable for controller who operate with a	degree	of social anonymity , uphold the rule of law and the abstraction of the legal system . in such a world , individuality be never a prize characteristic , and an attempt in the early 1980 to remove the one remain individualizing feature the shoulder numeral or collar number be correct reject by civilian as a structural move towards an even great anonymity . as reiner ( 1980 ) suggest , the riot gear in which the police be increase see , with shield , visore helmet , knee - length boot , and flame - proof overall , enhance they avenge appearance .
the detective on the other hand , immediately set out to reduce this cultural created separation , for he need to negotiate a statistical reality with the dirty prig opposition . the real poli be programme to maintain a conceptual purity by maintain structural distance , while the detective , of necessity , be force to reduce this to carry out he deal with the dirt . by reduce the social space between the dichotomy of order law enforcer and uncontrol prig , the detective necessarily return a	degree	of humanity to the prig which the uniform collar feeler be always structure to deny . the lowly poli , with little or no power in the system , deplore this situation and complain of it escalation , while the detective moan about the incompetence of the uniform wolly who never get close enough to they prisoner to extract they own cough or admission and who fail to understand that the system large depend on the ability of the department to manipulate a statistical norm in detect crime . stead ( 1980 : 305 ) , like mervyn jone ( 1980 ) , have also point out how police organization attribute low status to beat work , and ask the service to reconsider the value of the patrol officer :
it lie along the line of layton 's understanding of the poetic function which exist somewhere between fact and imagination , as eli mandel say of he . not pure fact , not meretricious research , which observe and tame the insightful - prophetic thrust ; not mere imagination or mental excitement but the fruitful intercourse between the two , in an artistic equilibrium . leonard could be fastidious to the nth	degree	in complete he own work he have always say that he work one word at a time , and can spend month , even years , in add finesse to it ; he be nevertheless dismissive of anything approache scholarly exactitude , still much so pedantry . it be not clear where this come from . there be certainly an element which high value the propriety of artistic freedom : a work of art must be a work of free spirit , untrammell by rule and regulation , wherein absolute consistency or conformity of any sort be out of place .
it be doubtful if leonard learn much law from scott . even when in lecture , which be not often , he mind be elsewhere . but there be a	degree	of comprehension , if not agreemend , from the professor . scott be in fact a poet of considerable skill he a found father , no less , of canada 's emerge poetry movement , and the doyen of poetry in montreal , which have produce so many excellent poet . an odd diversion , perhaps , from one of the country 's lead constitutional lawyer , but he be seize of the gift , and so the poetry become assertive .
leonard be actual look in a shop window when he first see they , notice marianne naturally first ! she take he breath away , as she do many man 's . he never realise , on that eventful day , that she would come into i arm ( as he put it ) and stay there for so many year , add in no small	degree	to the legend of love which keep the world sane and hopeful . there be serious work , however , at hand for leonard . he write , prose and poetry demande rigorous attention , and receive it with the same daily routine that he have establish early : three page a day , write and rewrite , creative and self - critical .
to describe self - govern perceptual sequence , kant give the example of scann the front elevation of a building ; in do which we determine what we see and the order in which we see it roof , front - door , top - leave - hand window , and so for . obviously , each kind of experience necessarily contain element of the other . thus , there be some	degree	of selfdetermination in the ship case because we be free to shut we eye , to cross the river and see it move from right to leave , free to jump into the water and watch it come towards we , free to determine the speed with which it pass across we visual field by move we eye with or against it movement . in the house example , we can choose the order in which we see the part of the building but we sure cannot see occluded portion , and we sure cannot look up to see a thatch roof because that be the kind of roof we want to see when the roof be tile . in fact , in every microsecond of perceptual experience there be a tension between the real as refractory , as something we cannot choose or will , and the subjective as choose and will .
scientific measurements may correct , reform or at little question individual unaided observation but there cannot be a systematic , universal discrepancy . the cash value of scientific observation in this context must therefore be base upon subjective experience and cannot be great than the cash value of the latter ; for it be subjective experience that , ultimately , validate we objective scale of energy intensity . we may use physical method of measur light intensity that be apparently independent of we subjective experience for instance photosensitive cell but this be accept because they correlate to a greater or lesser	degree	, under normal circumstance , with subjective experience of brightness . if there be simply no correlation whatsoever between the electrical output of a photo - electric cell and some other measure of light intensity directly or indirect relate to experience , it would not have be accept as a way of measur light intensity . however indirect relate to sensory experience a laboratory quantification of a particular form of energy may be , in the end the rate of exchange between one form of energy and another the way in which we compare the quantity of one with the quantity of another - repose upon the gold standard of subjectivity .
in another context , picasso once turn a bicycle saddle and some handlebar into a bull 's head ; transformation through the eye of a genius ! use of line design compose of small mass of veneer form a readable picture , correspond rough in look , if not in colour , to subject as they actual appear to the eye ; they seem to be in 3d even though they be flat , and to a	degree	they be naturalistic . there be another branch of graphics , however , in which an image be produce by the use of line rather than mass . in it much basic form the technique involve mere an outline , or when it be fill in , a silhouette ; but of course it can be much very elaborate than that .
despite the immediate success of the new fleet of 125mph train which bring new standard of safety and on - board comfort firstly on the western region service out of london ( paddington ) and then on the east coast main line from london ( k 's cross ) , so much of what have be gain in the late 1970 be lose as the economic recession start to bite . the impact be twofold . the sharp decline in business activity severe reduce the volume of full - fare first - class ticket sale while the increase in unemployment and intere rate curtail to a drastic	degree	level of disposable income available for leisure purpose such as optional standard - class rail journey . this loss of optional travel be also exacerbate by the intensify competition from longdistance coach follow the liberalisation of route license in the 1980 transport act . give the choice in such circumstance , many of intercity 's customer on low or fix income in particular student and senior citizen prefer the cheaper but slow coach option .
an important feature of the 1980 which have contribute to intercity 's financial turnround be market segmentation and price or the shape of product to meet the need of customer grouping . essentially this concept be not new from the early day we railway be provide first - , secondand even third - class accommodation and the excursion ticket be quickly use to sell spare capacity . what be new be the much greater	degree	of sophistication which be now necessary to produce the maximum revenue yield from each and every intercity journey . today 's equipment train and track be very expensive to provide and maintain ; to cover it basic cost it have to be in service provide revenue for up to say sixteen hour per day . but , as we know , demand for seat be not evenly spread .
br could not avoid pass it dramatically increase cost follow the oil crisis on to it customer , especially london commuter , and as they reduce in number ( demand fall at 1 per cent a year ) service , stock and facility be reduce to match demand , inevitable caus poor morale . even the ever - ebullient sir peter parker see part of the commuter system rattle into decline , and nobody be surprise when in 1979 the government referr the service to the monopoly merger commission . the commission 's report be perhaps the turn point , for while it pay respect to the management it find to be totally dedicate to the railway with a high	degree	of pride in the service which come before financial reward in importance , it make think - provoke recommendation about management style and the need to set clear financial objective . in particular br be advise to create a new senior post at headquarter with special responsibility for london and the south east . how do the transformation come about
through the late 1980 another force be at work which turn the provincial sector 's fortune far round . increase prosperity in the unite kingdom mean that people have much spare cash , and much of this be spent on an increase in personal travel . the new train on the provincial route therefore have a market with a	degree	of positive elasticity not previously enjoy . inevitable the service which have be plan on the basis of high seat - load factor quickly become overcrowd . provincial have be bite by it own success .
it be free from many of the constraint of timetabling , share usage of stations and so on which limit the extent of true independence amongst the passenger and parcel sector . it have be able to sh it loss - make operation without the need for lengthy legal procedure such as that which normal accompany the proposal to close a branch passenger service . the further division of railfreight into five subsector , namely coal , construction , petroleum , metal and distribution , have expose the strength and weakness of individual traffic flows and keep the	degree	of cross - subsidy within the sector to a minimum . all the way through railfreight 's emergence as a viable , forward - look concern , the emphasis be on improve the service to the customer . a bad reputation have resulte from year of unwieldy and sometimes inefficient management , coupl with the inherent un - reliability of the old wagonload system .
few would deny that the railway be admirable suit to carry this type of traffic . so as the 1980 draw to a close , the sub - sector dub coal , construction , petroleum and metal be all in fine shape , and they outlook for the 1990 be promise . not that the eighty be without they problem : quite apart from the industrial recession of the early year , which affect all railfreight 's bulk traffic to some	degree	or other , there be the historic miner 's strike of 19845 , take heavy toll of steel as well as coal carrying . happily the coal traffic be revive to the point where pre - strike tonnage be exceed , although the number of individual colliery serve be vastly reduce . the merry - go - round system which allow load and discharge to take place while an entire train remain in motion have continue to form the mainstay of railfreight coal 's operation , and it be difficult to imagine a much efficient alternative .
this dance matter very much to petipa and all nineteenthcentury balletmaster because they be expect to show off the wealth of talent find in the many imperial , royal and state theatre , e.g . all the character from other fairy tale who come to aurora 's wedding and the character dance in swan lake . mim dance and dance mime however , the strict division of a ballet into four distinct kind be eliminate by fokine when he totally cut the scne d'action from he first ballet and never replace they . instead , he use what he call mim dance or dance mime , insist , when ask fur an explanation , that there be a subtle difference between they , only one of	degree	. to fokine , l sylphide be mim dance because he have incorporate a few conventional gesture into he choreography . fokine say that every phrase of he dance be a gesture , and explain : undoubted an arabesque have many meaning but only when it appear as an idealised gesture .
schoreographe can also take a very subjective view of they work . this be equally important and have so prove throughout ballet history . the choreographer seize on the personality of a particular dancer and create ballet through which the dancer gradually develop and disclose unique talent and quality to such a	degree	that audience soon recognise a star . the name of four choreographer immediately stand out . taglioni recognise he daughter marie 's quality of other worldliness in la sylphide ; perrot discover carlotta grisi 's unique quality as an actress - dancer in giselle ; fokine expose tamara karsavina 's many - sided brilliance in such work as the firebird , le carnaval and petrushka ; ashton foster margot fonteyn 's vary personality .
moreover whole hops use for dry hopp take seven to 10 day for the character to be extract and then slowly decline . dry hop extract provide immediate character which last long and reduce the possibility of infection be add from whole hops or , very likely , from a dirty hand . because of the	degree	of process involve , hop extract be not necessarily cheaper than use whole hops . per unit of bitterness they be rough as cost . instead they attraction lie in they flexibility to ensure great consistency in both bitterness and flavour , in avoid the effect of oxidation and in be easy to handle and very suitable for bulk brew procedure .
many of the peaks have route on they that can be descri as form a midway point between hard alpine and himalayan standard long ridge route that take several day to accomplish ; big face route on rock and ice . other , like schkelda and ushba , have be partially develop but still have plenty of scope for new route . yet the highest of they all , elbrus , have a route that would be accessible to many a mountaineer with only one of two alpine season behind he ; a route that demand no real technical expertise , but an ability to adap to altitude , and a fair	degree	of stamina . it be a long day out , but a many reward one , as i be to discover . i begin by take the cable - car and the chairlift beyond it , then wander up the low glacier to the hut .

this be what many owner say when confront by cherish furnishing , door frame or personal item , such as book or the remote control for the tv , that have be tear to shred by belove rover in they absence , or nearly as distresse the evidence of he lack of toilet control . they assumption that he know what he have do wrong be base on the fact that rover be slink along the floor with it head and tail down look for all the world like a naughty school boy who be just break the headmaster 's window . on the basis of this evidence they proceed to chastise rover to a	degree	consistent with they temperament . they be always surprise , however , that rover never seem to learn , whatever tactics they employ . this be not surprise as the dog 's capacity to associate a form of behaviour and the consequence of it be limit to less than two second .
it will cose you an estimate 10 per week to feed one dog . and what of the aggression aspect the medium have make so much of all dog , of any breed , have a	degree	of aggression , graham say . this be how they establish they pecke order in the pack . it be a trait which be essential to any canine 's make - up .
you should not tolerate you dog do something you feel strongly against . also , if you allow the dog to sit on you settee , then replace that settee with a new one you do not want the dog to sit on , you must not expect it to sudden understand why it cannot sit there . if you dog show a mark	degree	of aggression with which you cannot cope , you must get it to someone who understand the breed and can help . if , after that , you can not get it to live amicable in a domestic situation , there be not much hope leave , although graham stress he have have some success with temperament improvement by castrat the male . true case history
below that , different approach be necessary , until recently involve extract energy from atoms use magnetic field . heat be nothing much than energy of atoms in motion , so if you can slow down atoms , you be in effect coole they . within the last few year , physicist have come within a few thousandth of a	degree	of absolute zero use a new technique call las entrapment . the idea be to hit atoms head - on with las beam , slow they down . las beam consist of photon which , though small by atomic standard , have a cumulative inertial effect , dr carl wieman of the university of colorado , who head one research group , say that coole an atom with a las beam be like try to slow down movement of a heavy object by bombard it with p - pong ball .

this problem can be eliminate by , for instance , produce a bus bar with a range of slot spacing or do the fibre to produce a slight spread of magnetic field period . this effective spread out the resonance peak ( which at a steady temperature be very sharp ) , and produce strong coupling at a range of temperature . measur current with light : danny mcstay ( leave ) and welland chu harness faraday rotation to vary the	degree	of couple between a pair of optical fibre carry polarised light . this have obvious implication for make float current measurements in high voltage distribution system . the inset picture show a slotted bus - bar for use with the optical sensor .
bakhtin be unusual among literary critics in make the focus of he activity the novel rather than lyric poetry or drama . in practice , binary opposition be very liable to favou one term at the expense of the other , and there can be no doubt that bakhtin prefer the dialogic to the monologic ( a bias that be evident in everyday english , where to engage in dialogue be good , and to utter a monologue be rather bad ) . this emphasis make the so - call monologic form of literature problematical , and lodge quote from an interesting late essay by bakhtin which seem to suggest that all literary discourse be to some	degree	dialogic . to remove the distinction completely would seem to undermine the insight that have give force to bakhtin 's early criticism . lodge suggest that this need not happen , if one see the monologic and dialogic as dominant tendency rather than mutually exclusive term .
that share culture have go , though it trac have persist for a long time , at little among that unworldly old academics who assume that student of english will have read the whole of shakespeare in the sixth form , or that they can readily identify classical or biblical reference . the belate realization that this thing be no long so lead to the embitter and baffle reaction that they ought to be so . however , that be a declin reaction ; the experience of regularly interviewing would - be entrant to an english	degree	course soon induce a sense of realism . in the state of affair that still obtain when i enter the profession in 1959 the grammar school teach and the university teach of english be not radical different kind of person ; indeed , contingent or accidental factor might have determine which career path be follow . since then there have be a mark divergence between school and university ; student have become less well equip , and academics , particularly young one , have become much high - power , ambitious , and professionalise .
in the 1980 , follow on government cut in finance , british university have be engage in a desperate scramble for oversea student and the much - or - less economic fe they be require to pay . it be an undignify business , but survival demand it . higher	degree	in english be an obvious target for foreign student who have be train in the subject in they own country , and who wish to obtain a doctoral qualification in an anglophone university before they beco teacher . the university welcome they as a source of income ; some student be fund by they own government to obtain a doctorate and enter public service . there be , in one way , an admirable balance of supply and demand , and some applicants be good by any standard .
in such cas failure be even very painful than with a home student , and one have hear rumour of faile candidate have to return several year of fee to they government , and suffer even bad penalty . the problem be not universal , one must emphasize . some student , particularly tho from the indian subcontinent who have be select for commonwealth scholarship , be capable of perform very well at higher	degree	level , and then return to an academic career in they own country . when overseas student do present difficulty and i be sure many academics will be familiar with distresse or scandalous case it be not because they be lack in industry or intellectual ability . many of they would do perfect well in discipline which be less idiosyncratic than english and have a much obvious international currency , like linguistic or economic or market .
many of they would do perfect well in discipline which be less idiosyncratic than english and have a much obvious international currency , like linguistic or economic or market . but in this respect , at little , english in the english academy , as leavis like to emphasize , be not just another subject . it express a mystique , be to a high	degree	culture - specific , can seem elusive , and be not easy reduce to the rule and agreed procedure of other discipline . it be not just overseas graduate student who have problem . we must all have know home undergraduate who have work very hard on an english course , who may be ambitious to do well , and who still , to they intense disappointment , end up do bad .
i like graff 's proposal , but they seem to i utopian . they might work in the graduate school of a good american university , where a variety of method already abounds . i cannot see how they could be establish in british literary education , where there be no graduate school as such , and the narrow , uphill tunnel of a - level work lead on to the rocky , cloudy upland of the undergraduate	degree	, with it confuse mixture of practical criticism and thematic study , analysis and literary history , coverage and special subject . undergraduate of moderate ability do not much like be ask to choose between differ judgement on the same text ; i can imagine they become confuse and resentful if they be ask to choose between different critical approach and all they attendant ideological baggage . certainly , i have know some undergraduate who would rise brilliantly to such a challenge ; but they be an exception , and one cannot base a course on what would suit the exceptional student , much as one would like to .
there would be no fix canon , and no coverage . such a degree course would not suit everyone , but it might well be attractive to the late entrant and mature student who be increasingly common participant in high education , particularly in the humanity , and who bring valuable experience of life and work to they study , but may have rather little formal preparation . it would also be very appropriate for the unambitious student of moderate talent who current apply for an english	degree	, but would be very at home in a less intensive programme of liberal study . cultural study would provide a much productive environment for the radical aca - english departments , who have conspicuous energy and intelligence , but little literary sensibility or aesthetic interest . literature , when teach in such a context , would , no doubt , be give a culturalist and contextualist treatment , and i believe that there be nothing inherently objectionable about this .
the other part of i proposal will probably prive annoy to radical , thereby ensur a proper balance . if cultural study go it own way , what happen to what be leave i would certainly not favour a rump version of one of the current form of english	degree	, with they recurr argument about canon and coverage , the definition of literature , and the place of theory . instead , i propose take the logic of generic concentration as far as it can go , with a degree which would study , in detail , a single genre , poetry . there be certain academic precedent , particularly the uncontroversial establishment in a number of university of degree in drama , which do work previously think of as belong to an english degree .

there be certain academic precedent , particularly the uncontroversial establishment in a number of university of degree in drama , which do work previously think of as belong to an english degree . the other model i have in mind be the degree in music , which be intensive , technical , and demande , and attract a small number of well - qualified entrant . a degree of a comparable kind , direct at poetry , be , i think , feasible , and would be very coherent and reward than exist	degree	in english literature . it would attract the automatic charge of litist , but so , potentially , do many worthwhile kind of intellectual activity . the reason for concentrate on poetry be that it be the much visible literary , formal , and conventional of the major genre , and would provide the good scope for study within an aesthetic frame of reference .
such a statement imply that there be aspect of poetry which may not be so easily teachable . indeed , hopkin distinguish between rhetoric and poetical insight and inspiration . the model , as i have say , would be a	degree	in music , and would include history and theory as well as analysis . much importantly , it would also include exercise in composition , of the kind once common in the study of classics . i prefer not to call this creative write , since the late - romantic ideological implication of creative be irrelevant , even undesirable .
i prefer not to call this creative write , since the late - romantic ideological implication of creative be irrelevant , even undesirable . the intention be that student of elaborate structure in language should be able to construct they as well as receive and consume they , if only to achieve a good understand of how poem be make . something of the sort have already be introduce into some english	degree	, under the aegis of the verbal art association , who have make a welcome start with such work . the reading of english poetry would be accompany by a consideration of historical as well as current theory of poetry . this would include the argument of the major poet - critic of the past : sidney , jonson , dryden , johnson , and on to the romantics , victorian , and modernist .
there be an element of utopianism in drafte such proposal , though i believe this idea be worth pursue . the student intake would be limit to that who have a genuine literary sensibility , who be interested in poetry , and be already in the habit of read it . this might exclude many student who be currently enroll in english	degree	, even tho with good a - level which can now be obtain very large by study drama and fiction . indeed , i be not sure what the correlation would be between formal attainment and the right quality need to take a degree in poetry . some student enter it could have quite other claim and qualification than a - level english .

some student enter it could have quite other claim and qualification than a - level english . it might well appeal to poet or would - be poet , who , contrary to popular myth about inspiration , be usually keen interested in the technical aspect of composition . what i have propose in the foregoing page be a conscious surrender to the culturalist of much of the activity that now go on in english	degree	, in order to retain something very coherent , defensible , and inherently valuable . culturalist will point out as c . s lewis once do that much poetry of the past be not write for aesthetic end , but for religious , political , or other social purpose . this be true ; but such poems have outlive they original purpose and now survive as aesthetic entity .
but a restatement of that ancient affinity should strengthen poetry against political and culturalist claim . the academic study of music may be a specialist field , but music , of every kind , be widely diffuse and perform ; only a small percentage of that attend concert or recital will have take degree in music . similarly , one would like to see a state of affair in which many much people read and enjoy poetry than have take a	degree	in it . the degree in poetry i have outlin would attempt to be open about it theoretical assumption . i do not believe there be any absolute virtue in such openness , in fact , i think that education be ideally carry on in a share form of life where there be agreement about fundamental and attention can be concentrate on the task in hand .
in the 1950 , it seem as if there might be a place for literature in the academy , so that the write of fiction or poetry , of criticism , and the teaching of literature would become a unify form of life . as we know , it do not happen . thirty year on , english be a large and entrench subject , and there be no likelihood of put the clock back , and start again in some other way : i proposal for a division between cultural study and a	degree	in poetry be a pragmatic proposal for a way out of current difficultie . other factor , like the institutional need to advance knowledge , to publish , to engage in research , and generate performanceindicator , would remain , whatever new academic structure emerge . there be , however , another way in which a useful advance might be make .
naked emotion grant the work an uneasy power but at time it feel like special pleading . after all this , the plot of la bayadere come as outrageously irresponsible nonsense . yet during he saturday night guest appearance julio bocca dance the ballet with a heroic	degree	of conviction . as the warrior solor he possess neither the exotic n of ruzimatov nor the romantic height of cope and a dispassionate viewer would admit that he turban give he an unfortunately gnome - like appearance . but he be not only a fine actor and an even fi dancer he be also uncommonly and unabashedly sexy .
extra appointment could be financ by the court 's customer pay high charge when case be set down for trial . a much difficult problem be ensure the extra judge be of a sufficiently high calibre . if much judge be require because of the greater	degree	of litigious activity it be logical to assume that that successful counsel of high calibre who would be candidate for judge 's office would find it economically very gratify to remain as advocate , he say . bear in mind the commercial raison d'etre of the court , there be a case for paie it judge much than that in other division . there could also be a commercial court of appeal with it own , high paid , judge .
perhaps , though , wilson be mere distract by the fact that , during he first appearance , he briefly disappear before return partially superimpose on a map . he eyebrow float over glasgow and he mouth seem to toy with eat leed . the debut of breakfast news be technically imperfect to a surprisingly high	degree	. apparently uncertain as to camera angle , witchell and the other frequently give the impression of have spot a lesbian stalk across the floor . but it be good , with a relaunch , to have technical rather than conceptual failing and breakfast news should yet become a decently serious morning service .
pope john paul , in he encyclical sollicitudo rei socialis , have repudiate not only marxism but the so - call civilisation of consumerism as destructive of true humanity , substitut have for be , and root in structural oppression of the poor . this be not to propose christianity as a counter - ideology . there can be no christian blueprint for the final form of society , since it be part of it perception of the human condition that all forms of society be provisional , reflect human sinfulness , though not always to an equal	degree	. it do , however , have a missionary vision of what it mean to be truly human , derive partly from rational reflection on human capacitie and desir , but supremely from it conviction that we glimpse true humanity in the life , death and teach of jesus . both liberation theologian and the policy - maker of the vatican be agree that , measure by the pattern of self - give love reveal in that life , western consumerism offer a perverted account of humanity .
perhaps because to think about reform be to think about it purpose , mr honecker and he colleague keep they mind close to such challenge . yet the west german , too , may be underestimat the pace at which history be move today in central europe : too fast , in all probability , for the smooth transitional arrangement which the kohl government in bonn like to think will one day lead to a painless form of reunification . letter : anticipate a	degree	of elitism from dr erwin kronheimer sir : have anyo a suggestion about how , once we have make all we graduate pay for they own education through some sort of lifelong surtax , we should set about stop that with any marketable skills and sense leave the country as soon as they possible can
sir : have anyo a suggestion about how , once we have make all we graduate pay for they own education through some sort of lifelong surtax , we should set about stop that with any marketable skills and sense leave the country as soon as they possible can would it be a good idea , perhaps , to introduce exit visa letter : anticipate a	degree	of elitism from m alice goldie sir : i be study for a - level at the moment and have just send off i application form to study medicine at university .

there , too , under china 's post - 1997 regime , peking would be free to declare martial law ; and there , too , a garrison of the people 's liberation ari would stand ready to suppress opposition or criticism by whatever means deng and he successor deem appropriate . much grist have fill the pessimist 's mill in the year since the joint declaration , as peking have grow much assertive and london much timid . within month of the sign ceremony , china be object vigorously to british proposal for introduce a meaningful	degree	of democracy to hong kong 's political structure . britain bow limply to china 's demand even though this mean weasel - out of previous pledge to put a representative elect government into hong kong before 1997 , and even though pek it have promise a hong kong run by hong kong people . the foreign office and the hong kong government try to camouflage they retreat with windy evasion , talk piously of the need to create convergence between what hong kong want for it future , and what china be prepare to permit .
member of the institute be know as acis ( associate ) and can ultimately become an fcis ( fellow ) . a recent survey conduct by icsa of it member in management role , show that a high proportion serve at or near board level . mr sheppard , who be now a fellow of icsa , begin he career with an economic	degree	specialise in business administration from the london school of economics . he want job - relate , professional qualification as well as a degree , though do not want to enter article to become a lawyer or accountant . grand met employ 25 qualified charter secretary throughout the company , say mr sheppard .

however , a widening of access require that the university attract and support under - represent group , such as work - class school - leaver , black and asian student , parent and mature worker . simply increase the number of university place will not in it increase access . without a major programme of affirmative action in recruitment , admission , teach , and assessment , any expansion of high education will result in very privileged middle - class young people gain	degree	. the majority of british people do not find university attractive or accessible . if the current proposal be not inform by an accurate assessment of the attitude of a representative sample for work - class school leaver and they family , then they relevance to the issue of access be unproven .
there be a crack group like nexus here , for heaven 's sake , and nobody know . two of the nexus percussionist play on monday , along with another musician who be one of the fine current exponent of she instrument , the violist rivka golani . consider purely as a recital by golani , this be a rivet evening : in such a	degree	of intimacy she littrestle prowl , crouch , rise to full height , even stamp , combine with the intense commitment of she play not to impede the music but to dramatise it , to add a further dimension to it urgency . the page - turner wisely sit far back , follow he own score . much of the piece , certainly , need all the dramatising they could get .
the political consequence be first increase loss of control and crumbl of the party apparatus , next the state 's need to fall back on the army and police to preserve it own existence , public order and , it claim , the chance of impose painful economic reforms . martial law , capable of preserve order but not reverse economic decline , in turn yield to semi - pluralism as the principle of the party 's monopoly of power be jettison to create a national consensus behind measure to salvage the country 's economy . army rule and multi - party democracy be , to an almost equal	degree	, anathema to the soviet party leadership , mikhail gorbachev inclu . moreover the politburo can argue both that political pluralism be no panacea for economic problems , and that it be much easy to apply in poland than in the vast multi - ethnic soviet empire . in propose a ban on strike , the soviet leadership therefore wish to nip the incipient labour movement in the bud .
but nor be it fair that with 6 or 7 per cent of the vote , the west german liberal should be the sole arbiter of who rule in bonn . the case for electoral reform be good discuss in terms of the question : what kind of political system do we want we electoral system strongly favour two - party government ; other people 's system , in vary	degree	proportionate , result in coalition of a usually centrist tinge . the difference go far deep than the political complexion of the government . the strong tendency of pluralistic system of europe be consensual and , in some cas , quasi - corporatist ; on the other side of the coin , they enable extremist minority to thrive .

read barrie clement 's diatribe ( 6 october ) under the head union law policy remain unclear , i wonder if he have attend the same labour party conference as i do . the party now have a clearer , very comprehensive and much explicit statement cover the whole range of industrial relation policy than in the past . it be a firm and robust statement which we believe will command a very high	degree	of public support as be balanced , fair and even - hand . in addition , the union unanimously support it . that give we a far strong base from which to campaign on trade union law than we have have before .

( ' you have to attain a high	degree	of musical stupidity in order to find watch the beat , or the conductor 's inane face for that matter , easy for the purpose of know how or when to play than simply listen to the music , he argue . ) but in the twenty century , conductor have replace composer as the much influential people in musical life . they determine repertoire , secure multi - million - pound recorde contract , hire and fire player .
the two man be bear in the same region , the transkei , but whereas mr mandela be a distinguish personage of royal blood , mr sisulu come from an impoverished peasant family and engage in politics as a consequence of he exposure to the daily indignity of life for blacks through he work in a dairy , a bakery , in mine and factory . but mr mandela arrive in johannesburg penniless , while mr sisulu be already in the anc , gain prominence through he work in the union . mr mandela sotch out mr sisulu and be reward with a loan to buy a suit and money to start a	degree	course in law . mr sisulu 's generosity and warmth do not waver during he time in the maximum security prison of robben island , where other inmate defer to he as a charismatic senior statesman of what have be call the government - in - exile . one trait that former robben islander recall be he remarkable , almost photographic , memory a quality that serve he well in he ascent through the anc hierarchy .
now that president f w de klerk have announce the release of eight of the nine much prominent political prisoner in south africa , the question be when not if the ninth , nelson mandela , will be freed . and it be look increasingly as if the date will be as much mr mandela 's own decision as the government 's . for the much remarkable thing to have emerge from mr de klerk 's decision be the	degree	to which mr mandela and the exiled african national congress have become participant in government decision - make . he have acquire an autonomy and influence stagger even by the standard of a country where anomaly be institutionalise . indication of mr mandela 's grow political stature in the eye of the government have be accumulate for some time .
and should we introduce a common core as in american university as the educator of a large student body , we should expect to ensure that art graduate be numerate , scientist literate , and both fluent in a foreign language . one option be to have basic	degree	course , follow by an extra year which would be take by that wish ultimately to pursue a career relate to they chose subject . the teach of specialist options be relative expensive ; this might enable university to maintain intellectual standard at a low unit cost for the majority of undergraduate while still serve that who need very advance knowledge . the debate should not , however , centre on cost , but should hinge on the ultimate benefit to the nation .

that it do so , so profound , be a vital part of what it be for . there be spiritual value in the very handle of it primary element to write a little song or dance , even an exercise ; even , as bruckner use to show he classes , in a fifth or octave struck at a piano . the essence of music 's high flight be transcendental in the high	degree	imaginable , in way that be manifestly intelligible and effectual , and quite insusceptible to verbal accounte . debussy 's answer to a journalist who ask if he be familiar with heaven yes , but i do not natter about it with stranger - be not so silly as it sound . evasive certainly , but only to acknowledge what cannot be utter .
the good composer express what he feel and make what he be make , from an essentially musical motivation , by essentially musical means , with all the skill and experience he can command . the end be various : here a visionary oratorio , there an opera buffa ; here a craggy piano etude , there a melt morceau de salon . the	degree	of inspiration , be the measure whereby they can be value ; through this be achieve , consciously or inadvertently , the height and depth of spiritual expression whereby they be a joy for ever . music can only be judge on the basis of an attentiveness to it musical essence as sensitive and discriminat as possible . above all , as specific - an undogmatic reaction to the detail in style and technique of the particular composer , piece , or passage .

in blackpool the stron feeling among representative have be one of relief that the party sing in harmony under stress . but the tory anthey be loyalty , not joy . the many strike aspect of the past week be the	degree	to which the government be underestimat labour 's post - conference political strength . among tory mp there be calm trepidation . among minister the mood seem unbelievable complacent .
while beck 's adventure be cut short , nick faldo , beat by lyle in last year 's final , go into overtime against david frost of south africa before come through on the 38th hole . in a match make in heaven , if not the sponsor 's dream , faldo will play ballesteros in the semi - finals today and rafferty will meet ian woosnam . on the prospect of face ballesteros , faldo , who do not get a	degree	in journalism , remark : with all the time he be have off this afternoon i hope carmen will have wear he out . i hope she give he a right go over . carman ballesteros , for one , would probably love to know exactly what he mean by that .
while there be study of the ruc 's role in security and public - order issue ( brew et al . 1988 : 4784 ; enloe 1978 ; pockrass 1986 ; weitzer 1985 , 1986 , 1987 a , b ) , this form only part of ruc duty , give the special position of northern ireland among divided society . primarily , however , an empirically base study of public order police be impossible to undertake in the midst of the province 's continue violent conflict , and certainly could not be do with the	degree	of depth , empirical focus , familiarity , and , frankly , personal safety which an ethnographic study of routine policing allow . nor would such a study have be give permission by the ruc , for it be utopian to expect police authority in divided society to open up this sections of they force to scrutiny and observation by outsider . an analysis of routine policing at little allow the possibility of empirical research be undertake on police force operat in divided society , which be it important because study in the sociology of police focus almost exclusive on police force in stable liberal democracy .
and , far , in area like easton , where there be very little crime relate to the trouble , the police do not on the whole develop the attitude that law and order be a battle between the ruc and catholic . this encourage a balanced view of catholic , something which , as we shall emphasize in late chapter , can be absent amongst some policeman beleaguer behind they reinforce stations in area of high tension and conflict . a final point worth make in defence of the data be that the observational material cannot be impugn to the same	degree	, because in the flow of action during an incident the exigency of the situation usually take over , make it difficult for policeman and woman to act in way contrary to what the situation require or they colleague demand . hence many extract from the data use in this volume be near - verbatim record of natural conversations in reallife setting . while on the whole we feel knowledge of the field - worker 's religion be not detrimental to the research , we believe it also have positive effect , in that it immediately force respondent to confront they attitudes toward catholic , as do the field - worker 's gender in relation to sex role in the force , place both issue high on the research agenda .
that be true . there use to be a woman sergean in place who use to refer to the reserve man as dick - head reserve man , fuck idiot , till one day this reserve man say to she , see that man over there , before he come to this job he be a aircraft technician , name use to be a chief mechanic . name there use to be a architect and name have a	degree	in law . and he say to she , what do you do before you join the police and she run off . she use to be a check - out girl in name of supermarket .
be the observer in the land rover on patrol be unpopular because sobserve do the paperwork on incident ; that who cannot drive be thus left with a great deal of boring work . it also affect the evaluation of incident and what count as a good turn . incident be categorize by the	degree	of paperwork involve , and the good shift be that where you be keep busy but with stuff you can clear up on the spot ( fn 26/5/87 , p 34 ) . great pleasure be therefore take when the buck be pass and the paperwork be hand to someone else . and there be occasion when banter and humou be use by low - rank officer to convey the impression to the section police that they should go easy on the number of skull ( prisoner ) they accrue because of the excessive paperwork it be caus .
( b ) less develop incomes here be between 401 and 1 , 635 , with a	degree	of industrialisation in the economy , supplie car , truck , building material etc . some export be see , and the pool of cheap labour and resource mean that they may begin to pose a competitive threat . ( c )
( e ) control of the company there be often political pressure on a company from the country in which it operate to allow a great	degree	of control to be exercise by the country concern . although a transfer of the ownership of a company be unlikely to be well receive by the board , care should be take before make the decision on how to react ; agree to increase national control can be less harmful than ( for instance ) withdraw from the country altogether . the ultimate sanction a country can levy nationalisation ( expropriation ) of operations be not unknown , but be less frequent than be sometimes believe .
group country into cluster identify different sub - grouping within all the country research . typically , country be cluster on the basis of macroeconomic data such as gnp per head of the population	degree	of urbanisation , population size or density , between level and so on . who should control international market research it might be apparend to you from a description of market research technique that many of this technique depend on comparison between different country .
ln addition we use voter 's degree of preference for they first - choice party ( over they second choice ) as yet another potential influence upon they rating of the medium 's usefulness . the main influence on usefulness - rating be people be inter in politics and they motivation for follow the campaign . they	degree	of preference for one party over other have an important influence upon the usefulness - rating they give the medium for help they decide how to vote ( that with clear preference find the medium less useful for that purpose ) but have little or no influence on other aspect of usefulness - rating . surprise , perception of bias never have a significant impact on usefulness - rating . the factor influence rating give to television for provide information on personality and issue be almost identical to each other .
but the factor influence rating give to television for help people decide how to vote be different . once again , motivation be a key factor but it be vote - guidance seeker , not information seeker , who now rate television much high . since that showe a	degree	of consistency in attitude , it be not entire unexpected . much surprise be the relationship with political interest . television score well on help people decide how to vote if they find politics intereste during the campaign but have lack a general interest in politics in the mid - term .
television score well on help people decide how to vote if they find politics intereste during the campaign but have lack a general interest in politics in the mid - term . television therefore hel make up the mind of that who be newly interested in politics , or unusual interested in politics , interest in the election campaign but not very interested in politics very general . rating of radio news be less predictable than rating of television but they too be influence by recent political interest , motivation for follow the campaign , and	degree	of party preference . once again , perception of bias have no influence . similar factor explain newspaper rating also .
third , the press be partisan , biase , and proud of it . the press always have be a medium of propaganda as well as a medium of information . particular paper vary in the	degree	to which they emphasize propaganda rather than information , and this emphasis also vary through time . in the final 1987 election campaign the press become very partisan and it emphasis on propaganda increase . the tabloid in particular carry relative little in - depth information but a lot of propaganda .
this time sequence be conclusive . television bias be not the cause of declin expectation of alliance success : it be a consequence of declin expectation amongst both journalist and the public at large ( table 7.3 ) . relative coverage of labour and conservative be always biase towards the conservative government but the	degree	of bias increase sharply ( it triple ) in the four week of the campaign . yet public perception of conservative chanc of victory sink to a minimum in that four week and assessment of labour chance reach a peak then . ( though conservative chance be always rate much high than labour 's . )
by that measure of visibility , national politician be much very visible than local candidate from the start . indeed , kinnock and thatcher be very visible in we pre - campaign week , when both be on high publicize foreign tour , than they be during the campaign it . they	degree	of visibility be also very predictable than the visibility of local candidate , though they visibility become less predictable as the election approach . before the campaign opened that who be particularly interested in politics be very much very aware of thatch 's and kinnock 's recent activity . by the end of the campaign that be no long so true .
the conceptual distinction between perception and attitude be clear ; but perception of party chanc or the state of the economy imply an element of approval or disapproval when articulate by the electorate . ( they be purely objective perception when articulate by political scientist or professional economist , of course . ) this perception be influence in vary	degree	, though not completely determin , by partisan loyalty . as the election approach , perception about party chance of victory become very homogeneous : many voter think conservative chance be good and alliance chance be poor . perception of labour chance remain very predictable , though they too become rather very homogeneous as the campaign come to an end .
overall television fulfill it public service role of inform the electorate , and do so particularly well as the election draw closer ; while the press fulfill it self - assign role as pamphleteer within a libertarian system , and do so with increase effect as the election drew closer . prescriptions supporter of the libertarian ideal must be please by the	degree	of public satisfaction with the press despite public perception of press bias . indeed they must be please by the trac of evidence that suggest that bias in a freely chose medium such as a newspaper be actual popular with the electorate rather than resent . similarly they must be please by the trac of evidence that suggest partisan voter find the relative impartiality of television news somewhat irritat .
the concept of a national centre have be a hierarchical mental device use by historian since the reformation to over - simplify the chao of diverse local stimuli . in primitive society with small , self - sufficient unit there be no differentiation between centre and periphery , and it could be argue that many peasant in russia remain at this level of perception during nep . yet urban , industrial polarization have already develop to a considerable	degree	before 1917 , create awareness of the political centre among the much sophisticate peasant strata such as village teacher , zemstvo clerk , bookkeeper , doctor ' and veterinarian 's assistants . e . d . vinogradoff have show how local agrarian social and economic condition shape the collective political behaviour of peasant elect to the four state duma . this be clearly the case in the central agricultural region , which we shall consider in chapter 2 .

the government 's hard - win economic plateau seem unlikely to last . len murray of the tuc work hard but be unable to exert power that he do not possess . a major factor be that the two famous leave - w union leader , both to some	degree	spoache turn gamekeeper , hugh scanlon and jack jone , be now remove from the scene through retirement . scanlon 's successor as president of the engineer 's union , terry duffy , be , in fact , a strongly right - w figure anxious to reach an accommodation with the government , but naturally it would take he time to build up he authority . jack jone 's successor be moss evan , a welshman who have work in the car industry as tgwu national organizer .
the partial compensation find in the fertility of the black and brown immigrant of the commonwealth country who have send over 3 million people into britain since 1962 do not meet with universal enthusiasm , as the evidence from the race relation board frequently suggest . afro - caribbean huddle in ghetto area like brixton or southall . non - white briton be have a grow impact , notable in mass sport and entertainment ; commercial advertisement to an increase	degree	focuse on a poly - ethnic consumer market . but only an enlighten few see this as a symbol of national renewal . in the face of this vary sense of internal malaise , the return of the thatcher government , with it young - turk generation of monetarist and entrepreneur , mark at little a change of gear , even if the privatization of publicly - owned enterprise be a very minor feature of the conservative manifesto in 1979 .
the real essence of thatcherism , indeed , lie not so much in it idea , which prove to be increasingly malleable as the year go by , and especially when nigel lawson take over the treasury in 1984 . it lie rather in the company it keep , the classes with which it be associate . as not , mrs thatcher come from a relatively humble , unprivileged background , though a	degree	at oxford and late marriage to a millionaire businessman give she a distinct haut bourgeois status in time . but she outlook be subtly different , say from that of edward heath , who father be a carpenter in a small town in kent and who , like mrs thatcher , go to a local grammar school rather than the private boarding school favoure by many tory leader . the heath background be one of constructive , but deferential , work - class toryism .
he be replace by the safe , if decidedly dull , figure of sir geoffrey howe , a diplomat not a policy - maker . in he place at the treasury come the younger , almost reckless , figure of nigel lawson , an able former financial journalist and apparently still a nominal enthusiast for monetarism . to an increase	degree	, the government and it outly establishment bore the prime minister 's stamp ; she press secretary , bernard ingham , seem very powerful than many cabinet minister , somewhat on the pattern of lloyd george 's use of bronco bill sutherland in 191822 . there be personal setback , as when she close political confidant , cecil parkinson , have to resign from the government in october 1983 after a sex scandal involve he former secretary . but this cause little permanent difficulty for the government .
indeed , fleet street it be a misnomer from 1985 onwards , as modern technology and high unit cost lead major newspaper to move out of central london to the eastern inner suburb , to avoid the union 's stranglehold . the long , sometimes violent , dispute with the print union over the relocation of the time plant at wapping mark a notable step both in the new financial and technological independence of the press and it ideological separateness from the union - corporate approach of the past . the church of england be also , to some	degree	, a victim of the thatcherite attempt at hegemony . the church have continue to lose member in the 1970 and 1980 , yet it remain a powerful source of social criticism . it 1985 report on the inner citie , faith in the city , be attack by government minister for it alleged marxist inspiration .
for decade , as the royal commission on wealth and income demonstrate in the late 1970 , that disparity be modify by the social benefit available under the welfare state . by the end of the 1980 , partly as a result of deliberate government action , very perhaps because the unduly optimistic assumption of beveridge and other founder of the british welfare system be be falsify by financial and cultural factor ( such as the breakdown of the old nuclear family of fabled tradition ) , the welfare state be far less able to temper the asperity of a harsh and divide society . the beleaguer rank of social worker and investigator of the 1980 document a society very unsettle , very helpless , and to some	degree	very violent than at any period since the century begin . final , there be constant angst about britain 's world role . the direction of britain 's post - imperial policy be unclear after 1945 .
apart from work closely with the benevolent fund , the association be contribute to the work of the council of british service and ex - service organisations . already we be provide , through the association 's war pension officer and area welfare officer , support to we sister charity , and in turn we have benefit from co - operation in the design of train cours . we have make a sound start in 1990 to achieve the	degree	of co - operation and mutual aid that we know the government and public expect to see very in evidence throughout this decade . as the year end the event in the gulf remind we sharply that we cannot take peach and freedom for grant , and that substantial risk continue to be face by that serve in the royal air force . in turn this may lead to welfare need extend well beyond the year 2000 .
he work hard , which be rare among the undergraduate of magdalene college in that day , and come out with a high degree in mathematics . though the college be very anglican , he retain all he family 's loyalty to the congregationalist tradition and way of worship . after a time teach in a scottish school , fettes , the	degree	get he a fellowship in mathematics at he own college of magdalene ; where he remain the rest of he long life teach mathematics , hold various college office , go every week to emmanuel congregational chapel , and become after a time one of it deacon or church officer . he be a good mathematical teach and he wrote a number of text - book , some of which go on sell into the 198o . to the outward eye he be austere , even bleak .
when a considerable proportion of the industry be work competitive for the market , the inducement to employee and employer to introduce and operate incentive scheme will be great strengthen . experience in the past two and a half year have show both the general effectiveness of such scheme and the need for a much wide extension of they . final , in location , size and amenity , the private builder ( include to a large	degree	the house association ) necessarily build to suit he customer and thus provide an index of demand . the distortion which occur under a system of all but exclusive local authority house - build the tendency to conform to the past rather than the future location of population ( with consequent immobilisation of labour ) , the wrong proportion of house of different size , and the provision of much amenity than that for which tenant be prepare to pay the economic price this will naturally correct they when private building be restore . to combat the opposite extreme of jerry - building , we would make membership of the housebuilder 's registration council 's register compulsory upon all contractor for local authority house , with a view to render the building industry eventually an industry subject throughout to public - appro standard .
( it be a standard procedure of politician , when embark upon a course which lack logical coherence , to disarm critic and criticism by descri what they do or commend as only a first step ; for who can demand logic from a first step ) unlike the mother - country and it dependency , above all india , the self - govern colony be protectionist ; but they be now prepare , and indeed in some case be anxious , to afford the mother - country preferential treatment within they tariff system if the mother - country would reciprocate . in order to do this , however , britain must he become in some	degree	protectionist and place tariff on foreign import of at little the thing which the dominion have to sell to she above all , food , if not also raw material . it be thus a revolution in british fiscal policy which chamberlain advocate in the name of empire ; and from he birmingham speech in may 1903 until he be strike down three year late he advocacy of tariff reform and he imperial theme dominate british policy . yet the imperial side of the argument whatever view may be take of the fiscal , economic and domestic would not stand up to examination .
aspir rock artist should remember one golden rule when deal with the press : there be no rule . winn the favour of this curious breed be largely a lottery . that with any	degree	of power and influence be already deluge with promotional material , atrocious record and pre - release cassette , the vast majority supply by the generously resource press office of major record company . only the much conscientious ( and , frankly , that with nothing good to do ) dutiful plough through everything that flop out of a jiffy bag and on to they desk . the few communication which do receive full attention normal achieve this through a combination of chance , inside information and relentless harrassment .
self - reliant act independent companies be often the setting for band who already have an idea of the sort of music they want to make , and where they want to end up . very importantly , independent can be the right place for artist who want to keep a	degree	of creative control . radio stuart grundy be an executive producer at bbc radio 1 , with direct responsibility for evening and weekend programme as well as special event .
booke agency agreement all of this are for a personal service . as such , they involve a high	degree	of trust , good will , confidence and faith in all party 's ability to do the job in hand . musician must seek legal advice if they be offer any of this agreements , and they legal adviser should be a specialist in the music business . a solicitor in divorce law or conveyance will not deal with the music business on a day - to - day basis and he or she will not be able to advise you fully on the term of a music industry agreement .
the first issue be when a formal agreement should be make between the member of a band . ideally , some sort of agreement should be work out fair early on . this give each band member a	degree	of security . if there be no formal agreement between the band member , and if the band have be work in practice as a partnership , i have always view the band as operat as if there be a formal partnership agreement . in that case , the follow rule normally apply .
in the uk in 1983 there be a by - election in bermondsey , london . it run - up include a homophobic attack on one of the candidate , peter tatchell , who political extremism be regard as inseparable from he sexual deviance . it be large mobilize by sections of the press , to a	degree	then unprecedent , but which herald the onset of the intensify homophobium which have characterize that country ever since . take only the period in which this book have be write , and limit the location to the uk , there have be numerous similar press - provoke scandal in which the homosexual have keep turn up where he or she should not , especially at the respectable centre of thing : in mi5 , the house of parliament , as parliamentary candidate , schoolteacher , council employee , prison chaplain , vicar , guard to the queen mother , film star , circuit judge , to cite only some ( and some who life have be destroy by homophobic medium harassment ) . the same press represent homosexual as the corrupter of public moral , of child , the family , and even the armed force ; or as deviant convey to other alien ( they external counterpart ) the state 's innermost secret .
william perkin set out the conventional position vis - - vis class . dress , he say , must be answerable to we estate and dignitie , for distinction of order and	degree	in the society of man . this use of attire , stand by the very ordinance of god ; who , as he hath not sort all man to all place , so he will have man to fitte they and they attire , to the qualitie of they proper place , to put a difference betweene they and other by which it appeare , that many in this day do great offend
late , in december 1985 , the archbishop of canterbury 's committee on the inner citie present it report , life in the city . this contain many proposal for the regeneration of this area , include great central government expenditure , which run counter to the government 's idea . the report be immediately dismiss as marxist by a government spokesman and criticize with vary	degree	of vigour by many conservative . this attack in turn have be meet by forceful rebuttal from conservative back - bencher and from the prime minister herself . the tory critic object that the church be peddl left - w politics as a religious message , while fail to assert moral value .
mrs thatcher have be fortunate in that retirement of several senior personnel in the early 1980 give she the opportunity to influence promotion ; there be thirteen appointment as permanent secretary in 1982 alone and she have have a hand in appoint the great majority of permanent and assistant permanent secretary since 1979 . the traditional trade - off for the secure tenure of senior british civil servant have be that they be anonymous and politically impartial . to some	degree	the impartiality have depend on there be a large measure of policy agreement and continuity between the party in government . the doubt of some pre - war labour leader that the civil service would actual co - operate with a radical labour government be large laid to rest by the experience of the attlee government . but radical in both party who favoure radical change , either to the left or to the right , have frequently condemn the civil service as the embodiment of an above - party consensus favour continuity of policy .
they also embark on an ambitious national scheme that be design to place britain at the forefront of the postwar civil aviation market . british air travel before the war have large be in the hand of two companies , british airways for european service and imperial airway for service far afield . both function with a	degree	of official support , especially in the form of mail contract , but prove they to be unprofitable in the face of subsidize foreign competition . in 1939 , after several year of study , the conservative government attempt to reorganize the rather inefficient operation of the two airline and to encourage much competition . the result be a single national airline that be to be the so - call chose instrument for british air service : british oversea airway corporation ( boac ) .
in the immediate postwar period germany constitute the single much important drain on the dollar . this be an unintended consequence of britain 's successful attempt to occupy the much industrialize and populous part of germany . in other word , to a	degree	the burden of germany on the balance of payment be in part the result of britain 's great power posture , and not just the consequence of the military pattern that emerge in the conquest of germany . unfortunately for the british government , this occupation zone be unexpected severe from it traditional source of food in the east , and be unable to feed it became relian on supply of food from dollar area . the position be rectify only slowly , the usa take on first part and then , by the end of 1947 , the whole of the burden .
in the 1910 general election the conservative main gain have be in the county generally and the southern county in particular . the land campaign , or so it seem to the conservative , threaten to wipe out that gain at a time when the party show no sign of an electoral recovery elsewhere . the conservative 's desperation to devise a counter - programme for the land , and the disagreement it provoke , demonstrate the	degree	of confusion which still exist in the conservative rank and the immense problem they still face before the rampant omnibus of the great war rescue they by run down they opponent . it be a pity that fforde 's determination to present the conservative party as decided individualist prevent he from explor the confusion in the conservative ranks indicate by he evidence . if dispute within the party over policy and doctrine be one symptom of conservative confusion , another be the legion of league which appear in the late nineteen and early twenty century , when it seem that hardly a year go by without the founding of some new right - w association .
the labour government , then , be not wholly the prisoner of dogma . ( it may still have be the prisoner of vested interest , but that be another matter . ) as long as keyne pitch he argument for credit expansion within the bound of orthodoxy , he dominate the proceedings of the committee and achie a	degree	of consensus . stamp , for example , be sympathetic . pigou share keyne 's analysis of the disequilibrium between saving and investment , and be prepare to endorse public works .
in concentrat all matrimonial legislation in a new secular high court in london , the act also represent the success of common and equity lawyer in captur full control of matrimonial litigation . to explain the nature of legal change stone offer a model that suggest first , that clients reveal the gap between current value and the law ; second , that this be follow by the attempt of lawyer and judge to narrow the gap , often by invent legal fiction or effective change the law by judicial re - interpretation ( the changing definition of legal cruelty provide one example of this ) ; and third , that all this culminate eventually in legal change when the level of duplicity and hypocrisy become intolerable to lee lord and legislator alike ( pp. 1920 ) . this model , which echo that use by oliver macdonagh to explain the growth in nineteen century government , rely on a high	degree	of consonance in the wish of lawyer and they client , a not unreasonable assumption give the limit access to divorce in stone 's period . but it be not a model that hold up for the twenty century , when liberalization of the divorce law be not a matter of last resort but be rather always propose as a means of strengthen the institution of marriage ( by permitt that living in sin to remarry ) ; when opinion shift with dramatic speed , for example between the conservative recommendation of the 1956 royal commission on divorce and the endorsement of profound liberalization give a mere ten year late by both the law commission and the church of england ; and when the change in view of key institution such as the church of england be as important as that of lawyer . the permission give by the 1969 act for no - fault divorce be drive as much by a profound rethink of the source of morality by clerical and academic opinion as by the determined pursuit of individual self - inter on the part of either the population at large or lawyer in particular .
there have be some rather unrealistic valuation be put on business . but i think the critical issue of black monday and what be happen since be that this be a very major change in the nature of the market place , but not in the underlie economy of country , especially the uk . i think we will continue to have a	degree	of volatility in market we have not experience previously and i think the way the market maker have to interpret he role now be such that we will never get the sort of fine tuning that the old jobb system could provide . with so much very volatility in market , it be perhaps inevitable that great stress will be put on senior executife as they strive to adap to , and cope with , ever faster change . the ability to deal with crisis be something cuckney have cultivate over the year .
finniston firm believe that a lack of training and inadequate educational facility be two of the major stumble block to industrial efficiency in britain . he cite some statistics from two recent report to support he argument : of all the people who call they manager or be designate manager in japan or the us , eighty - five per cent have a	degree	qualification . the figure in this country be twenty - four per cent . in the us , west germany and japan five full day every year be devote to off - the job train for every manage .
i work in the coal mine for three year to obtain i colliery manage 's certificate . as part of the train programme , you have to spend this period underground , of which eighteen month have to be spend on the coal face and during that time you do lot of job that mineworker do . at time it seem a bit strange to have a university	degree	and be work so physical hard but in many way that three year be a very good period . in particular , haslam find the camaraderie he experience work alongside mineworker extremely reward . it be rather like be in the army on active service .
you be not conscious of they weigh you up , but they do . the chance be that during the first eight or nine year you may appear to be tread water in the process of prove you . you can have the finest	degree	in the world , but at the end of the day you be judge as an individual and on you performance and they thing begin to happen . some people in ici still come up by one functional channel and reach the top , but much emerge people get the management development treatmend rather like i do . run the film group for ici give haslam particular pleasure because it be the first time he have ever be fully in charge of a business , which he find very challenge .
another look after the monthly staff employee . a third be entirele concern with management development and career plan and the four act as a one - man think - tank , who task be to advise on how ici 's personnel policy should evolve in future . it do not bother haslam that he have to rely to a large	degree	on the expertise of other to perform he own job well . i think the art of move around as i have do in i career into different product and function and into various industry be the ability to sum up quickly you close colleague . you can never hope to achieve the professionalism of that who have be in a single business all they life and hence you need quickly to get to know that who opinion you can trust .
when only five year old , he use to go into the bakery with he father before school just for fun . he and he brother would take delight in cut out oat cake . at school he do extraordinarily bad by he own admission and he also fail to obtain a	degree	in agriculture at cambridge university , but with he sight firm fix on a career in the family business , such academic shortcoming represent no real handicap . he serve with the 3rd battalion of the scot guards during the war , but final , in 1947 , he be able to fulfil he long - cherish ambition to savou company life . from the very first day i enjoy it .
this be true even though the rule party initially the tanganyika african national union ( tanu ) and since 1972 the chama cha mapunduzi ( ccm ) have always accept a system of primary election to select parliamentary candidate . in the four general election hold since independence the turnover of mp have be as much as 50 per cent . in contrast the authoritarian nature of tanzanian politics can very useful be measure by the number of political detainee which exceed several hundred in the mid 1970 or in term of the	degree	of pressure bring to bear on the rural population from 1974 to 1978 . it be also true at a much subtle level in that nyerere , perhaps the fine political debater in africa land responsible for the first translation of shakespeare 's julius caesar into kiswahili ) , leave he with no - one to debate with , at little until he leave the presidency to be party chairman in 1985 . he survival over the year since independence in 1961 do not alter the fact that the discussion of real policy choice in a public manner have hardly ever occur .
a survey of the 1320 companies registere in nigeria in 1970 indicate that 400 be wholly foreign - own , include nearly all of the large . in the same year in kenya it have be estimate that african citizen and government institution own only about 5 per cent of corporate asset . consequently , relation between african country and international companies be for twenty year characterize by a battle to take some	degree	of national control . strategy for control have include the compulsory sale of 51 per cent of the share capital in the business nationalize by tanzania 's arusha declaration in 1967 , the compulsory sale of the majority of share capital by all large company in nigeria from 1974 to 1977 , and the creep sale of 20 per cent of issue share capital in the ivory coast require from 1975 onwards ( achieve by issue new equity ) . in tanzania , julius nyerere comment , we purpose be primarily a political purpose ; it be an extension of the political control which the tanzanian people secure in 1961 .
it be recognize that the integration of some kind of livestock far with crop would ultimately be desirable . it be strongly support in the 1950 by the company who purchase the cotton grow as a cash crop in the savannah , because it appear to be the much effective way to reverse the declin fertility and fall yield which have become apparent by that time . the development of the system span very than twenty year and achie a	degree	of success in term of it define objective . it be unpopular political , as it involve a good deal of compulsion , and do not survive the chao of independence . however , it be probably the much serious attempt make in colonial africa to adap the traditional bush/fallow system to change economic circumstance and , if sustain , might have provide technical answer to problem which still prive elusive .
he see the range of legal and bureaucratic constraint upon they as be the main limitation on they develop into self - sustain business . this argument be part valid in the african context : mutang'ang 'i be periodically oblige to remove he metal cutt machine from he worksite in nairobi . on the other hand , a systematic survey by the international labour organization have show that , in a sample of ten african country , 40 per cent of informal sector enterprise pay some form of tax or registration fee , imply a	degree	of recognition by government . by the late 1980 no african government could afford to neglect the significance of the sector for the employment of the hundred of thousand of primary and secondary school leaver who be join the labour market each year , and many be make policy statement which indicate some support for it . however , it be also prove difficult to discard old attitude .
alhaji abbo be a former truck driver who have successfully develop a 3, 000 hectare maize farm and oil extraction plant in northern cameroun . in 1989 he be oblige to move out of he house to live on the farm in order to avoid the pressure to entertain visit dignitary on behalf of local politician . thus whether the would - be efficient entrepreneur rise from the informal sector or parachute into a large - scale enterprise with a	degree	from an international business school , he will frequently be trap into the same style of run a business as the nigerian enterpreneur descri above . ~_~small be still beautiful entrepreneur in pre - colonial africa be effective in articulat trade relationship between africa and the rest of the world , and in develope the productive activity which generate the trade .
there be good reason to ask to who can the asset of the grain market board be sell yet the world bank have continue to press this issue , at one stage move the permanent secretary in the president 's office to angry rebuke the young leader of the bank 's team , and to the president he be move to recount to the team the biblical story of the seven fat and seven lean year . there be no easy answer to african development , and an appropriate	degree	of humility on the part of donor be a necessary condition for develop a serious dialogue with recipient government . pump primer or drip feed the confidence display by the world bank man and other donor in the early 1970 have clearly not fulfill it promise .
he be merrily accumulate a large bag of small fish when fred smith come along with inadequate tackle , throw a lump of luncheon meat in the margin and land the large fish in the lake . i be afraid this will always happen . on some water you can gain a	degree	of selectability by use harder and large diameter bait . for instance it could be a good idea to introduce you free boily at 12 mm or 15 mm and use hook bait of 18 mm , 20 mm or maybe even 22 mm . this will not stop you catch the small fish but it may sw the odd in you favour of select one or two of the large fish .
the problem be i do not know where he have be place this shot . the first adjustment i would make would be to try position the three to six no . 6 shot at one inch gap , start ten inch from the hook as in diagram a . this lose a slight	degree	of sensitivity by not have a dropper shoot but usually do the trick of hold the float stationary . several shot lie on the bottom act good as a brake if set slight apart from each other . this strung shott technique often require you to fish two or three foot overdepth .
he be late to become suspicious of maine 's motive , however , as he be to see in the glorification of contract a subtle justification of the legal institution of capitalism , and he be to see in maine 's insistence on the primacy of the monogamous family an attempt to prive that this institution be beyond historical change . in the same year the swiss scholar , j . j . bachofen , publish da mutterrecht , ( mother right ) , a book show that matriliny , the tracing of descent through woman , and matriarchy , the dominance of woman in society , as well as the cult of female goddess , preced the patriarchy and the patriliny we find in biblical and classical society . this idea be accept with vary	degree	of caution by many nineteen - century anthropologist and ultimately be wholly endorse by engel , who , in the preface to the four edition of the origin of the family , private property and the state , give warm praise to bachofen . bachofen and maine be soon follow by j . f . mclennan , a scotsman who work in part coincide with that of bachofen and maine but which develope much very the study of kinship system . this focus on kinship have an influence on both marx and engel which culminate in they enthusiasm for lewis henry morgan who two principal book have a decisive effect on they late work .
he do note , in the letter to zasulich , morgan 's hope for a future society , which would abandon the obsession with private property , but at the same time he make it clear that he rightly do not consider morgan a socialist or a revolutionary . engel , on the other hand , state in the preface to the first edition of the origin that morgan in he own way have discover afresh in america the materialistic conception of history , discovere by marx forty year ago , and in he comparison of barbarism and civilization it have lead he , in the main point , to the same conclusion as marx 's p 71 . this be high praise indeed from engel but there be no hint in any of marx 's own wri of that	degree	of endorsement for morgan 's theoretical position . the origin fall into three part . the first , represent by chapter 1 , deal with technological evolution .
tony and i get up as quickly as we can , brush the snow free from clothes before put they on so that it will not meld with the heat from we body . we tell nat to stay where he be , brush the snow from he bag to try to minimize how wet it will be . the advantage of the temperature be so low although it have rise several	degree	with the cloud over be that the snow be like dry flour and brushe off easy . it be late when we wake , and by the time we have cleare up the mess it be late still . worke outside be difficult in the fresh snow and when the wind pick up again we admit defeat and agree that we will stay another night .
they be not mere documentation . they be in fact significant element in the story of situationism which be the subtext of the book . the political reticence evident in this volume be indicate by a	degree	of randomness in the choice of material and by implication a commitment to the much expressive or irrationalist side of they work . it be , for example , reveal that there be no indication in either book of the situationist commitment to political struggle in the third world and they critique of imperialism . the introductions in both book be anodyne and brief .
he regard he as a liberal and a friend of black people . if representations be make to he , by , for example , mp , about specific case , lyon often interven to help the people involve . in he own word he be seek to get immigration control on a basis where it be firm but where it be administer with some	degree	of compassion for the individual case . but if you want to be humane you do not last long as minister with special responsibility for immigration because the policy you have to carry out be so inhumane . lyon be sack soon after callaghan become prime minister .
the 2.5 - litre 90deg six , which be recently show at detroit 's society of engineer show , produce a hefty 7500rpm and 184lb ft of torque at 5000rpm . the all - alloy 24 - valve twin - cbe engine be descri by cosworth as be of the high - efficiency type , and follow the modular theory mean that the basic design could suit anything from the three - cylinder unit to a v12 . use it patent low pressure casting technique , cosworth have be able to incorporate a high	degree	of stiffness in the compact unit . as a result , it will be suitable for both longitudinal or transverse setting , and can sit low in a chassis . no manufacturer have yet commit it to use the cosworth engine , which be expect to be fully ready for production by june .
as before , the 325i 's front suspension be by strut , coil - spring and an anti - roll bar . at the back , however , the old semi - trail arm set - up be replace with what bmw call a central pull - rod axle essentially the multi - link arrangement with centrally mount longitudinal link use to great effect on bmw 's now - defunct z1 sport car . bmw claims that this far much sophisticate ( and , no doubt , expensive ) rear suspension final lay to rest the spectre of lift - off oversteer which have so bedevill the 3 - series over the year albeit to a much lesser	degree	with the outgoing model which , in sport form at little , we find to be well balance and responsive rather than inherently tail happy . indeed , first impression tell you that the new car 's chassis feel a little less sharp and agile than it predecessor 's . subtle , wrist - generate steere input do not do as much .
grip be not mere good than the old car 's , it be of a different order . but , and it be a big but , what the enthusiastic driver would once have interpret as an enjoyable adjustable corner balance have be squeeze out of existence . this one understeer by	degree	in direct ratio to speed . mostly the understeer be mild but , in the dry at little , it seldo give way to a genuinely neutral stance . even in the wet , quell the chassis 's instinct to run wide require concerted judicious throttle juggl .
i also checke that the electrically power bit and piece be operat properly . the central lock do not secure or unlock the front passenger door and all the lock feel rather stiff and gritty . both electric front window work , albeit with a	degree	of sloth and a slight graunch . similarly , the door mirror work but not with any great precision . tribute be large unknown to ford 's inject cologne v6 , but it be a worthy enough trooper .
if i heart be set on buy a sierra xr4x4 , 5000 for the ritchie motors offer would be sore tempt . the car be pretty sound in many respect well use but not abuse and the exist fault would , the dealership assure i , be rectify before it find a new owner . however , the lack of any service history be a major drawback when buy a six - year - old car with a great than average	degree	of mechanical complexity . in the end , i would have to move on from this example to examine other xr on offer around glasgow . but it would be possible that i might end up back at ritchie motors .
even against the estate , the ride/handling/steering/brak package be by far the much convince , as you would expect give sve 's involvement . it be not an easy one to get right either , with the greatly different torsional character of a convertible . certainly here be the only escort varian with a	degree	of throttle steer available ; a responsive chassis . and this , along with a firm , well - damp ride and hooray hooray ! properly shape seat , mean a drive experience of vast different character from the other . it be far from fast and there be some body shake over very rough road .
publican be still the much important occupational group , hold between they almost a third ( 31.2 per cent ) of all share . perhaps a stake in a popular club would give profitable return indirect through the sale of drink . the	degree	to which publican invest for this reason in football be unknown but the pecuniary advantage at first sight seem doubtful . there be all the difference in the world between meet a retired sport hero behind the bar and meet a shareholder or even a director . probably publican be just carry on an old tradition of involvement in popular sport .
peter mcintosh , the co - author of this report and a pioneer in the historical study of sport in modern britain , conclude that the state via the sport council should base both research and promotion on enjoyment rather than social function . commitment to sport have to be freely give ; it have to be fun ; it cannot be foist on to the poor or the wayward from above because it be good for they . this bring we back to a central theme of sport and the british : the extraordinary	degree	to which it have be promote private without politician , employer , or trade unionist take a significant part except as enthusiastic individual sportsman . people have create they own kind of pleasure through sport and there have be no powerful institutional push of the kind that come , for example , from the french church after 1905 or the german social democratic party of the wilhelmine era . britain even lag behind the unite states in the provision of industrial recreation facility .
well leave it , the look say . maybe it be very merciful this way . let she learn about it by	degree	. the mind have it own way of soften blow , he think sententiously . now back to the - er , accident , he say .
he want i mother to stay because she be a good hostess and keep house well . when i be eighteen i go up to oxford . after i get i	degree	i tell i mother i could keep she now and she should leave i father . she response be to deny everything and to tell i father to stop i allowance . he refuse to stop it mainly because i mother have ask he to , i suppose .
many animal be diurnal that be they be active in the daytime and inactive at night whereas nocturnal creature show the opposite orientation . in addition , particularly in hotter region , there be animal that be active about the time of dawn and dusk when it be not too hot or cold . we be all aware to some	degree	of the daily rhythm of nature around we . few people have not wake to the sound of the dawn chorus nor see moth draw to artificial light as daylight fade . birds become quieter in the afternoon , while butterfly and other insect be very active , feed on the open flower .
there be , however , some problem with this theory . it be not clear how the duration of sleep could be control as regularly as be observe to be the case . even though it might be argue that a regular life - style implies a regular	degree	of regularity be not achie . individual go to bed late or early than average on certain occasion , as can be see by close inspection of fig . 2.2 . for example , an individual might go to bed late than usual on one occasion because a piece of work or some leisure time activity take long than normal .
for alertness ( or fatigue ) the evidence must be base upon subjective measurements , but , for body temperature , objective measurements be possible . it will have be not that the rhythm of body temperature and alertness be time very similarly with high value in the daytime and low value at night ( compare fig 1.2 and 1.3 ) . this mean that a high body temperature be associate with a high	degree	of alertness or a small amount of fatigue . the detailed explanation of what make we feel alert be not know , but it be certain to be some function of brain activity , and brain activity increase with body temperature . this be because enzyme ( protein that be responsible for carry out the chemical process within the body ) act very quickly as the temperature be raise .
such a t combine element of group 13 . as another example , subject have to draw an irregular shape the shape be see as a reflection in a mirror . this combine element of group 13 and 5 with a fair	degree	of exasperation ! several task be require to be perform simultaneously and the subject be require to distribute he time between they as efficiently as possible . this be suppose to mimic the stress of the decision - make process .
particularly for old people this , couple with a tendency to have a weak bladder , can have distresse consequence . a knowledge of the rhythm in urine formation can be important when treatment with drug be concern since they be remove from the body in the urine . the	degree	of acidity of the urine show a daily variation , nocturnal urine be much acidic . many drug be acidic or alkaline and this affect they removal in the urine ; acidic drug be excret very easy in the daytime and alkaline one at night . since drug be cost , it might be desirable to give the drug when it be less readily remove by the kidney .
one company start the day with a military history lecture on the second world war , another be be teach the skills of interviewing , both by the academy 's own academic staff . for the senior intake and the woman 's standard course , breakfast be follow by military technology . the lecture team come from the royal military college of science , where army undergraduate read science	degree	. they will give presentations on that aspect of engineering and science that be have an impact on the development of military equipment and system . after the lecture the cadet be divide into group of about twenty - five to discuss the implication of all that they have hear .
the ta course 's patrolling be come on well and the visitor have move on to see what the junior intake be do . this officer cadet have be at the academy since early may and be now well into they fourteen - week first term . like the other intake they be a mixture of schoolboy entrant , oversea cadet and ex - soldier with vary	degree	of experience and proficiency in the rank . so far today they have be study how order for an operation be give and the particular way in which the army go about explain a complex undertak . when give order , much of the impact of what be say be derive from the stage management of the whole procedure .
the rest of i be just catche up . the pt instructor bark out he order with an enthusiasm that be unnatural for this time of the morning . member of headquarter battery follow they with vary	degree	of success . in the case of the postal order , he sixty situp must be on a cumulative basis . we have be here five month and he have one month leave to complete he sixty .
there be two possible strategy for the treatment of an attack of dry rot . the building owner may either employ a builder to carry out the work or open up and eradication , or he may call in one of the numerous specialist firm to deal with the attack . if a builder be entrust with the work , it must be ensure through a full brief and careful supervision that only conscientious , knowledgeable and skilled tradesman be employ who be able to give rational advice on the proper nature and extent of the remedial treatment if the initial assessment of the	degree	of damage prove to be inaccurate . the advantage of employ a specialist firm be that it tradesman be very likely to be well traine and experience in this field of building preservation , with a thorough and successful job be a much certain result . however , it should be clear that any firm which issue a guarantee must inevitable err on the side of over - zealousness , which will add to expense .
of course , it be not just the atheist who dislike he . it be a christian colleague in the english faculty who say , the problem of pain be quite bad enough without lewis make it bad . even tho one would expect to have rejoice at the religious revival which lewis 's popularity herald and to a certain	degree	inspire could only bring they to sneer . r h . lightfoot , for example , the chaplain of new college , and author of a learned commentary on st john 's gospel , remark to a young colleague of lewis 's : he defection to the area of theology be a sad loss to the english faculty . i wish it could be say to be a gain to the faculty of theology .
ingrid 's machine be a small and much - adapted version of the industrial , multi - needle monster use in the yorkshire weave and wooll mill to make insulat material and upholstery fabric . she will be use this for year , ever since a practical demonstration by an art - school technician fir she to experimend with felt technique . while study spin in huddersfield ( as part of she	degree	course in textile design at middlesex polytechnic ) there have be no time for she to try out the machine , so the then sceptical technician tell she to come back late . i wander down to huddersfield market and find some wooll scarve for 1 each . they make i wonder if i could use pure woven wool as a base for i own technique with the machine .
arty be sit up in bed , he hair shine from a liberal application of something that look and smell like perfume vaseline and come from a jar labell easi - gro . over he pyjamas he have put on a new fair isle pullover which have be he mother 's christma present . he be busy pru he nail with a pair of scissor and try to make up he mind about the proper	degree	of flippancy to adopt for he conversation with madeleine , when the romance of he afternoon be sudden eclipse by the strident voice of he father , grat like a rusty wheel on a dry axle . i be look for you all over . since when do they move you down here
cinema develop alongside the wireless and the telephone as communication media that would change the way people perceive the world around they . it be doubtful , however , whether this filmmak pioneer have any sense at all of the new invention 's potential significance . they may have feel a	degree	of excitement as they turn they camera on a train arrive at a station , wave crash on the beach , or a group of worker emerge from they daily grind in the factory , but this early piece of reportage be see as nothing much than animate photograph , a further step in the development of photography . a little late , as filmmaker begin to expend the medium 's storytell capacity , they draw from the technique develop for the magic lantern or diorama and audienc see a woman interrupt she husband in the act of kisse the maid , or a miller grappl with chimney sweep in front of a windmill . it be natural to see this moving picture as nothing very than a novelty , perhaps mere a passe gimmick ; they be , after all , only show as an additional turn on the music - hall programme .
it release have , however , be hold up for some time on instruction from c . m . woolf , a shrewd film salesman who have play a key role in financ the first project of both balcon and wilcox . the re - edit he demand have general be take as evidence of just that wardour street backwardness to which kine weekly allude . but while it be true that woolf 's disapproval of the film 's distinctive angle and extreme light contrast do betray a	degree	of conservatism and , in he late campaign against the man who know too much ( 1934 ) , he be clearly the enemy of anything even moderately original , woolf be not a simple philistine . brunel , no less committed than hitchcock to an artistic direction for british film , be late unstint in he praise of a man who by he faith and support set the pace at a time when we much need it and credit he with contribute very considerab to the renaissance of the british film production industry . give that the re - edit of the film reduce the number of title card from 300 to 80 , it be reasonable to assume that woolf 's intervention considerable improve the film , and that woolf 's commercial experience provide a valuable lesson both for hitchcock and balcon .

the other work in this boldly plan programme be stravinsky 's rite of spre , in an interpretation which be sure the product of much think on rattle 's part . it be as though he have analys the failing in many other account of the work and have deliberately devise the means to obviate they . the very evident tendency of the end of the first part to overshadow the final sacrificial dance be one problem he convincingly solve , partly by restrain the former but mainly by inject an extraordinary	degree	of ferocity into the fragmented rhythm of the latter . sadler 's wells . by mary clarke lcdt .

he say the nra want to talk to the commission to simplify the ec quality standard to make they very meaningful and achievable . he claime scientific evidence have show low level of salmonella in water be not a risk to health . in 1988 , 123 out of 364 bathe beach fail to reach european standard , but the nra say the present compliance figure almost certainly give an unrealistic optimistic view of the	degree	of compliance of bathe water . the commission want britain to build sewage works at the seaside to treat bacteria before it be pump into the sea . the chairman of the committee , mr hugh rossi , be concern about the government 's alternative plan to pump the sewage into the sea through long pipeline without treat the bacterium .
crossley have to move quickly to save a glance header from sharp and just when it look as if forest might be very grateful for a replay chapman win the tie . just what constitute time - waste be a matter for the referee 's discretion , and if tyson feel that southall be deliberately use up precious second he be entitle to award for that crucial free - kick . but everybody know that , in other game at other time with oter referee , goalkeeper will dally and dawdle to a great	degree	and get away with it . to be effective this kind of referee have to be consistent . otherwise the letter of the law be an ass .
the shortage have be worsen by lack of staff at hospital because of flu , mr graham hayter , of the emergency bed service , say . miss christine murphy , a spokeswoman for the public health laboratory service - a government - fund but independent organisation which also monitor level of illness say : this year 's virus be a sub - type of a strain we have see before and many of the case be not severe . child and young people be at great risk as the old element of the population who have experience this before will have a	degree	of resistance . vaccination be recommend only for people at special risk . the queen be force to cancel two engagement yesterday and another today because she have flu .

the directive be simply another obstacle which have to be take account of by broadcast authority when give effect to they duty to preserve due impartiality . second , the duty be to preserve due impartiality . it be for broadcasting authority to determine what constitute the appropriate	degree	of impartiality , and they must not lose sight of they obligation not to include in they programme matter which be likely to encourage or incite crime or be offensive to public feel . it be not self - evident that any impartiality be due to that who support or excuse attempt to achieve political change by terrorism . the decision whether or not to give directive involve the home secretary in make a delicate and difficult political judgment .

mr justice simon brown say he great prefer the approach adopt by professor jackson 's tribunal . it accorde with good sense and justice , and also properly reflect the important impact of the house of lords 's decision in shah v barnet borough council 1983 2 ac 309 upon the statutory definition of settlement for immigration act purpose . in shah 's case lord scarman say , all that be necessary be that the purpose of live where one do eg , for education , employment , health , family or mere love of the place have a sufficient	degree	of continuity to be properly descri as settle . why should an applicant , who must in any event be prepare to satisfy the primary purpose test , be bad off because he contemplate the possibility of a relatively short stay in the uk than one who have the fix intention of permanent uk residence it be logical to construe the phrase intende to settle in rule 41 differently from the contrast phrase admit for settlement which appear elsewhere .

it be nice to have the same player available from last season , but i think it will be a lot harder this time because the other home country have get to know we good . sole , of course , come to the attention of lead english player some time before he win he first cap against france ( an 18 - 17 win ) at murrayfield in january 1986 . in he final year at exeter , where he take a	degree	in economics and agriculture economics , he join bath just as the avon club start to take off on it four - year domination of the john player cup . it be a good place to learn you rugby , recall sole . everyone want to beat bath , and the game be always hard .
within a week she be live with a black foster parent , in the area in which she have grow up , and be able to resume contact with she sister . the second social consequence of care that emerge from carlen 's work be that not only be the education of the young person serious neglect , but so , too , be the emotional development . cecilia have do well she be now on a polytechnic	degree	course but nothing in she year in care prepare she for independent living . and for other girl in carlen 's study , the scar of have be in care be very vivid . many have be psychologically damage , like yasmin , who continuous self - injury mean that she be move into a much punitive environment .
excellent sound on the mid - price imp label . em i eminence be also promot completely new orchestral recording for it mid - price label , and sian edwards in she first major record draw brilliant performance from the royal liverpool philharmonic orchestra of the three much popular tchaikovsky overture , romeo and juliet , francesca da rimini and 1812 plus marche slave . the vivid recorde helps to bring out the	degree	of refinement that miss edwards find even in 1812 , without lose anything in dramatic bite . this be performance to make you forget this be piece usually treat as potboiler . horowitz at home be the master 's very last record , captur he at he many relax , when here he be play in he drawing - room on he own favourite steinway .
circan 1710 compton beauchamp shrivenham berkshire compton beauchamp house be a gem privily set in a bosky lap of the bare chalk downs where they meet the fertile flat of the white horse vale . it be a pearl of price combin in high	degree	amenity of position and charm of layout . so wrote mr avray tipp in 1918 , persuade the traveller to take the winding road from shrivenham ( pronounce shrinam by the locals ) and to glimpse down it fine avenue of lime herald what for all the world could be the petit trianon pluck from versailles and set down here in berkshire . at the begin of the eighteen century edward richards set about remodell he modest moate manor in the very late palladian style .
david ask if i could jive and at this particular time i always dress as a man , which be probably another reason calvin and i get along very well because calvin wear velvet suit and i wear velvet suit so that be one area we get on very well . but anyway , we jump to it and start to jive and i decide that we be quite sympathetic and we get along quite well a similar sense of humour , and lew attitude towards woman we just basically get along well . at the time i could not work legal in england and i have about two or three month to deliver i these for i	degree	. i be go out with this guy call john colley who relation be sort of minor gangster in london and i go to work for they because they do not mind i not be english . david and i go to the travel agency where i be work a couple of time and keep say , what be you do here
budyko think climate change be the good thing since sliced bread , say a us scientist at the world meteorological organization in geneva in 1989 in a conversation with the author . he be greatly respecte , but i do not think the soviet - lead impact group ( of the ipcc ) will reflect he view . other echoe he opinion , with differ	degree	of confidence . the belief in a scientifically - control world run deep in soviet society . if you can not escape you climate , change it .
he have try unsuccessfully to persuade government that it should devote a fix proportion of either gdp or the defence budget ( which have some logic as an idea , since the meteorological office be fund through the ministry of defence ) to research into global warm ; and failure in that respect have reinforce he view that government across the world find inexpensive word preferable to expensive action . he continue : although the political will have be express in vigorous , interesting and dramatic term at international conference , in i judgement the political will to follow through that policy right across the globe to a	degree	that will be effective do not exist . that political will do not exist because public opinion have not yet begin to be aware of the scale of possible change that government will ask they public to accept . ( and even if the political will do exist , he doubt whether the institution which would have to translate it into collective action be strong enough to do so . )
he put down the phone , rattle . with he much - love francesca come she four young brother for who , as the eld child of a widow , she have always consider he responsible . all four be talent musician and difficult people , in vary	degree	; tristram . one of the twenty - four - year - old twin , have prove the much difficult , perhaps because he be not the much talent . mcleish grit he tooth , and , try not to consider the implication of what he have be tell .
by that time there be three supersonic contender for the medium term : the english electric company 's p - 1 , which late become the lightning , the saunder roe p - 177 , which combin jet with rocket propulsion ; and the fairey delta - winge pd - 2 , in which peter twiss wrest the air speed record from the american in 1956 with a speed of 1,132 m.p.h . concurrent with this military development the british aircraft industry be wag a lose battle with the american for a large share of the civilian passenger and freight market . the health of the industry in the long term , and hence the	degree	of independence britain would attain in military aircraft production , would depend on the outcome . it be not a happy saga . commercial , political and military misjudgment play significant parts in britain 's defeat .
moreover , he do not cancel the development of the naval strike aircraft , the na 39 , which eventually become the high successful buccaneer . the navy can be say to have won the first round of the long - run carrier battle , which be to bedevil naval - air relation for the next decade . the naval shift of emphasis to limit war capability be strongly support by the general staff , who doubt whether the	degree	of strategic mobility , upon which sandy be bank to reduce oversea garrison , would be practicable with the transport aircraft likely to be available in the foreseeable future . quick air - reinforcement with infantry be one thing , but any serious fight or prolong operations would need far heavy load and great tonnage of ammunition and supply than the raf could lift in the required time scale . the gap would have to be bridge with supply by sea .
although the boto be a powerful animal , and can sometimes tear it way out of net , very often it become entangle and drown . the boto have also reported become adeep at steal fish from this type of net , and may cause considerable damage to the fish gear in the process . according to good and da silva , the	degree	of hostility from commercial fisherman towards the boto be unquestionable grow . in the past this have be counter by the numerous superstition of the indigenous people towards the river dolphin , but as the economic pressure of the commercial fishery become great , this superstition be likely to become less respect , especially by the young fisherman . development pressure in the amazon basin , such as the construction of hydro - electric dam , deforestation , and commercial fish , have bring a flood of new settler to the area .
the number of cetacean catch in gill - net through incidental catch need not be large to severe affect some specy , nor be catch confin to develope country . many of the specy involve be list internationally as endanger . the convention of trade in endangered specy ( cites ) have since 1973 aim to protect specy threaten by international trade , and list endanger animal in three appendice according to the	degree	of threat they face . appendix 1 be the much endanger list , and animal on it may not be trade for commercial purpose . in the gulf of california , the use of gill - net may have push the vaquita or gulf of california porpoise to the edge of extinction .
and new structure be always be find . the size of the large know structure in the universe seem to increase hand in hand with the scale of the large map . although inflation be invok to make the universe smooth , it can provide a certain	degree	of clumpiness . there will be fluctuation in the density of an inflationary universe . they alone would not be enough to account for the clumpiness on intermediate scale that study of the sky reveal ; but there be a way to amplify they effect .
one be to be with western europe , lead ( pretty explicitly ) by a unit germany . state department planner see neither of this partnership as necessarily limit geographically . the american have long be eager for the japanese to help latin america 's economy , and muse that the european might want to shoulder a	degree	of responsibility for africa . when mr bush and mikhail gorbachev meet in washington in june 1990 , a third partnership seem possible . once the soviet union allow pluralism in eastern europe , america be prepare to look for area where soviet help could come in handy .
the ec have have little to say about the gulf , and to that few have listen . this bother the commission 's president , jacques delors , who think the community have a part to play in the middle east . so , in vary	degree	, do the 12 foreign minister . they have now decide , at a meet in luxembourg , that there be one thing the ec cannot do and three thing it can . it cannot offer the territorial guarantee or military equipment that provide hard security .
in england , therefore , university start at the age of 16 and last for five year . at the end of the second year there be a stiff examination that knock out about a quarter of the student . the other move to different premise , where nearly all of they be give	degree	three year late . you suggestion for a - level , to keep one in - depth subject and cover five or six other at a low level , will not work ( april 27th ) . universitie will accept application mostly from syoungste who have do well in they in - depth subject , so 16 - year - old will still have to make the decision about they career at an age when many be not ready , and two year before many other european .
post - war america be in favour of a unit europe to stand very firmly against the soviet union , and successive american administrations grow irritable with the european for fail to believe that unity in europe could be as simple as it be in america . mr duroselle be catalogue , first , a tendency for european to be very similar than they be different , although they very diversity be what mark they out ; and second , the various aspiration if not actual attempt to bring european into conscious , and voluntary , union . he make a convince case for link of various sort and	degree	between west european country go back as much as 5 , 000 year , but he these have one weakness . the book call it a history of the european people . all the european people .
the patriot missile system be a good example . at it heart be a sophisticate phase - array radar , a stationary gridwork of tiny radar transmitter control by computer . by putte the element in the radar out - of - step with each other to various	degree	, the computer can use the array to make a radar beam that can flight across the sky and track a number of target almost simultaneously . when the system pick up an enemy , alert by a dsp early - warn satellite ( see box ) or an awacs aeroplane , the radar start track it . when it come into range , the system launch an interceptor .
in large section of punjab they extort money ( call it taxation ) , hold court , decree what local newspaper should print and even decide what dress schoolchild should wear . hindus have long flee the rural part of punjab ; now some sikh be join the exodus , disgust by terrorist excess that lead to 3 , 787 deaths last year and about 1 ,500 so far this year . the militant be splight between	degree	of intransigence , which could make they vulnerable at the poll . some have call for a boycott of the election , but much be likely to back the faction of the akali dal , the sikh political party , lead by a former police officer , simranjit singh mann . mr mann insist that punjab must be a homeland for the sikh , bring into be by a un - supervise plebiscite .
black need to realise that affirmative action cannot solve they much serious problem , white need to remember that affirmative action do not make it an advantage to be bear black . two bad idea clutter the debate . the first be black separatism , in vogue in university ( racially separate	degree	- ceremony and fraternity be popular with the people much angry at apartheid ) and with extreme black activist . but who can doubt that , if the two race be to eseparat , the black would be the poorer they live in a mainly white country , just as south african white live in a mainly black one .
mortgage . common law treat the mortgagee as the owner of the land in case of the ordinary legal mortgage ; equity treat the mortgagor as still be in a sense owner . it be true that it would not prevent the mortgagee take possession , though it make he position in some	degree	uncomfortable if he do take possession . but suppose that , as usually happen , the mortgagor be leave in possession , and that a strange turn he out , or try to do so . common law find a difficulty in protect he against the stranger .
under the common law , proof that the plaintiff have be guilty of contributory negligence , and that he have the last opportunity of avoid the accident , entire deprive he of he remedy . ( this rule ha , as we shall see , be alter by the law reform ( contributory negligence ) act 1945 ; see p 138 . ) maritime law divide the loss , at first equally , but now , under the maritime convention act 1911 , in proportion , as far as possible , to the	degree	of fault . the admiralty have from the first a prize jurisdiction , i.e . a jurisdiction to determine all questions as to the ownership of ship and good capture at sea by a belligerent . the lead principle of prize law be settle by lord stowell during the napoleonic war ; and they be the basis of the prize law which be apply in the 191418 and 193945 war .
during this interval any person may intervene to show cause , on the ground of , e.g . , the suppression of material fact , why the decree should not be make absolute , and a public officer , the queen 's proctor , be especially charge with the duty of intervening . insanity the nature and	degree	of insanity which will afford a defence to a criminal charge have from time to time be a matter of considerable discussion . where the defence arise we court will act upon the so - call m'naghten rule , propound by the judge in response to question address to they by the house of lords . an accuse person be presume to be sane , until he can prive the contrary .
moreover , there seem to be nothing artificial in principle in hold the act of an employee do in the course of he employment as equivalent to the act of the employer . this principle , be , however , apply in different degree in the respective sphere of criminal and civil law . a man be not punishable for a serious crime commit by another unless he have actual instigate the commission of a crime , and then he will be punishable though the crime commit may differ in some	degree	from that which he instigate . it may be not that in criminal law anyone who aid , counsel , or procure the commission of an offence be liable to be try and punish in the same way as if he be a principal offender . but in the case of minor offence , and especially statutory offence , which be anti - social rather than immoral , a man may be punish even for the unauthorize act or default of one in he employment .
he be only twenty when he make he debut in england in 1963 , prompt set a west indian record with 24 dismissal in the series . if he do not touch such height again , he remain a thorough reliable keeper right to the end , small , neat and quiet , and rare give to histrionics . he interrupt he cricket career to go to cambridge , who he captain , and then nottingham university to take a	degree	in business study , play for the county from 1966 to deryck murray , fresh from the shower , celebrate he seven victim in the headingley test of 1976 . 1969 while he be there .
according to he professor , he be thorough and conscientious rather than brilliant , take he study very serious since he want both to improve he and gain a qualification for when he finish play . it be during he second year at manchester that he be offer the west indy captaincy for the visit by pakistan , but decide that he study have to come first ; he have a strong sense of predestination and apparently feel that the leadership would be he eventually . complet he	degree	would ensure that he be good equip to do the job , especially as by study social anthropology he would be well able to understand he player . yet have the visitor be england or australia he may well not have be able to resist the temptation , and this be only partly because they be the lead light in world cricket ; there be also the racial aspect , in that he passionately want to prive that a team of black player lead by a black captain be the equal of , if not good than , the white team . no doubt it be difficult for young people now to appreciate the complexity and the rigidity of the social structure in colonial day .
brown , tan and olive be the original , classic corduroy colour , and when i say classic i mean specifically trouser , not jacket and certainly not suit . a corduroy suit be a contradiction : suit be dressy ; corduroy be not . the width of the wale ( ridge ) determine the	degree	of informality . wide wale ( up to nine rib an inch ) be the much casual ; midwale and pinwale ( ten to eighteen rib an inch ) be slight very formal , but it depend on you point of view . the head of a smart high - street man 's shop attempt to tell i why corduroy be superior to blue jean .
we just fly in a room , he like to say , move quickly across the ruin of daily life , plane crash , train wreck , matricide , infanticide ; then , after swatt half of humanity , he will low he voice and whisper , as if impart a secret , we just fly , that be all . get nowhere to fly , do we image and echo fill the room , diffuse and speed , the glass darkened to a	degree	no one think possible ; he immense talent , he re wisdom , he antipathy for chemical , argue against destructibility ; all he would ever do be grow old . for twenty year , while he turn the porn shop of sport into international theatre , attention be pay in a way it never be before or have be since . the crowd be a wonder to behold .

as i leave the railway station , the police warn i that there be a small demonstration against norman tebbit 's recent industrial relation reforms . that be the plan , but the morning 's press be full of extravagant report of the cut i intended to make in health service manpower . fowler be insert for tebbit on the placard and the demonstration go ahead with a	degree	of intimidation that make the front page of every national newspaper the next day . it be not just street demonstrator who be assemble against we . the nasti little attack we endure at this time come from , of all paper , the lancet .
i opened the conference to the press and the large room be pack . when i speak i make it clear that i intended to do something about the position of the early leaver and that i think it right that people should not suffer if they transfer they pension from one job to another . some of the industry recognize that change be due and with various	degree	of enthusiasm be prepare to go along with such proposal . what , however , cause almost universal consternation be i suggestion that we should go a stage far and see whether it be possible to introduce portable pension pension which you could take from one job to another . the industry be horrify .

many be bronze mirror with a normal tin content of approximately 10 per cent , which have be tin to produce a silvery reflect surface . the second type have no separately apply coat ; instead the whole mirror be cast in a high - tin bronze alloy contain about 25 per cent tin . this alloy be naturally silvery in colour and be much very hard - wear than a thin layer of tinning , but it require a high	degree	of skill to control the cast condition . the two type of mirror look much the same after be bury for century , but when the microstructure be examine at high magnification , as in figure 5.15e and f , it be possible to distinguish between tin bronze and the high - tin alloy . niello inlay
the former will cl rigid to formulae regardless of the situation , nit - pick over tiny detail but sometimes unwittingly miss the large issue . the pragmatist be very flexible , recognise that exception do arise and must be practically cater for . both attitude have a valuable role to play when consider an issue such as how to computerise a major corpus of information which exist in a variety of document type of vary	degree	of complexity and intelligibility . the british museum have a sound history in the field of documentation , even if we predecessor be on occasion less rigorous in they practice than be current staff . in 1756 the museum be compil record of it acquisition in bound ledger call the book of present and in 1836 the then single department of antiquity begin to complete bound acquisition register of a type still in use today ( fig . 10.1 ) .

a rule of thumb it will by now have become evident that this book take an unorthodox approach to art criticism . there will be no attempt to define exactly what art criticism be , or to set out a theory of criticism , beyond the suggestion of some	difference	in writing on art which have already be make . nor will a history of art criticism be attempt . the stress of the book fall on a viewer 's encounter with a work of art , and how a prior reading of a piece of art criticism can improve that encounter .
the decorative flatness and the high colour of japanis art also follow as product of the same climatic necessity . similar passag of critical reflection or speculation can be find in many book . formal	difference	in art have be link to place in vary way , one of the good - know renaissance contrast be the stress on line evident in florentine art as against the colourist approach of the venetian , a city on water . do an english like for watercolour spre from the country 's climate do the flat landscape of the netherlands impose a special sort of vision on dutch artist
do an english like for watercolour spre from the country 's climate do the flat landscape of the netherlands impose a special sort of vision on dutch artist the reverse of the coin be internationalism , a feature , some might say , of twenty - century art ; not so uncommon either in other period , where art historian struggle heroically to identify	difference	between the art of one country and another . some of this struggle have be inspire by base motive desire to appropriate art to a national or a political cause . but some such effort can have sympathy , as in that stirring of national spirit in central europe before 1914 , when literature , language and music be fuel for czech , polish or hungarian aspiration .
dictionary describe a monograph as an account of a single subject ; by this definition monograph make up one of the much common category of art publish . a book on a single painter , for example , be a monograph . there be some doubt in a grey area of	difference	between monograph on the one hand , and catalogue or biographie on the other . for convenience , biographie will be include in the present chapter , while catalogue will be treat in the next . there be a boom in publishe book about individual artist , especially tho who be already well know .
max friedlander , an outstand scholar of northern european art , take the view that accept a work into an artist 's oeuvre be like recognise a friend , not a matter of measurement or detail scrutiny . the reader be thus rely on friedlander 's eye . a	difference	between morelli and friedlander be that the former explain he method , while the latter do not . much than a hundred year have pass since morelli start write ; in that time many problem of authorship have be solve , while about other tacit agreement have be reach . the result of this process can be read in detail in catalogue raisonn , which often give a blow - by - blow account of the argument of scholar over the year .
a case of unwitt collusion by a critic in a manoeuvre by an art dealer occur in 1961 , when leo steinberg wrote an article about jasper johns . johns be a puzzling phenomenon for steinberg , as one of the artist of pop art , then hardly begin . the article appear in an italian magazine metro , who have intended to pay 300 for an article ; but when john 's dealer , leo castelli , know that steinberg be consider an article , he arrange for the magazine to offer 1 , 000 , pay the	difference	of 700 he . steinberg know nothing about it . the underlie question for a reader of criticism be what influence be exert on the critic ; but as in this instance , for long it may be impossible to know the truth .
it be not altogether satisfactory to call a print by an artist on the same theme as one of he painting a description . after all , it be an original work in it . nevertheless , the	difference	between paint and print may be instructive , and help the interpretation of both . by other form of reproduction an image may be very or less degrade , so that nothing can be learnt from they . there remain the courtesy pay by one art to another , as in the poem which baudelaire suggest might be a high form of critical wri .
hardship and discontent may declare they there , in a victim 's revenge . in address it to such possibility , however , a bend in the river , for all it air of simplicity , be never simple . it narrator and chief human presence be by no means straightforward a victim , and the	difference	between oppressor and oppress can be hard to identify . the novel be narrate by a moslem of indian origin , who family have be settle on the east coast of africa , as trader . salim leave they , take off on the first of a series of flight , and trek to the interior , to a country which appear to be compounded of the congo and of uganda , in order to earn a living from a store which he have acquire from a man who daughter he be expect to marry one day .
he find he consider the idea of flight , and the idea of defeat : 1 suppose that , think of i own harassment and raymond 's defeat , i have begin to consider yvette a defeate person as well , trap in the town , as sick of he and the wast asset of she body as i be sick of i and i anxiety . but the fit of jealousy in which he beat she would appear to mean something much than this word of explanation enable one to understand . this jealousy may be feel to be like othello 's in have very to do with	difference	of race , and with the jealousy of race , than the jealous man , or than the work he belong to , seems dispose to state . three of literature 's myth underlie the narrative . they be myth of the foreign woman , which bring together achievement and betrayal , achievement and desertion .
but be consol by another mother who seem unfrustrat make it hard to reconcile the two . this appear to be a key point , but it be one that be left controversial . it be possible to imagine that for some people such consolation might make it easy to reconcile the two , and to wonder what it be that make the	difference	in fraser 's case . there be other thing that have to be reconcil , and we hear presently of a role of inherent superiority which come to i from outside , from the servant among other . inside , however , i feel inherently inferior , inadequate to fill the role .
kapuscinski be a seeker of general truth who be spar with he generalisation , and who like certain kind of particularity but not other . the kind he like he call detail , as oppose to long shot the equivalent , that be , of the long shot over - use by cameraman of the iranian revolution : it be through detail that everything can be show that truth can be show . but in the emperor no detail be adduce that might bring out what	difference	there could have be between the courtier and petitioner of ethiopia and they counterpart elsewhere in the world . kapuscinski 's courtier and petitioner be about as black as johnson 's prince rassela , who be about as black as he be white . in the second book , a photograph be speak of which show the pull down of a monument to one of the shah ( father or son ) in teheran or some other iranian city .
true art , or the good art , have a dialogic structure , many voice , and so have the good society . this be an author who have contribute to the russia which have come after he to the emergence there , at the present time , of the demand for a lawful opposition , for the duality of democracy . the	difference	between an author who tell and an author who show , and who employ a medley of voice in order to do so . it be a distinction which may in the end prive very suggestive than serviceable : the author who tell , and who can be account something of a ventriloquist , may well , for instance , be much than capable of carnival , and may even be every bit as plural in he work as he dialogic counterpart . but it be possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lie at the heart of it may be successfully apply both to some sort of contemporary author and to some of what go before .
nathan zuckerman be a persona 's persona : roth begat peter tarnopol who begat nathan zuckerman in the novel of 1974 , i life as a man . zuckerman have enable roth to deal with the question of the offence he have give to righteous jew , and to come to terms with the rebellious , psychedelic , philo - semitic sixty , when roth be write go , with the time , derisive and fantastic . the zuckerman book be a medley of	difference	and affinity between what we be able to infer about roth 's life and what he have make of it in art . in proprium persona , roth discourse in the fact about he relationship with he young brother , sandy . the tone be judicious and kind .
and in what roth write roth and bellow meet . but neither of they be incapable of pursue the artificial fiction of be he . no one would light believe that either of they have ever find it hard to tell the	difference	between he and somebody else . dualistic explanation be move , and intrigue : but they be often think , even by proponent , to be far - fetch , fictional , theoretical , counter - intuitive . that bellow , this participant in roth 's inner life , can also be say to be out there in the world as he friend , and perhaps he rival , be a fact which do not help one to decide whether or not to trust the report of literary duality what come in have to have be out but it be very much in the tradition .
she display very sympathy for this anti - semitic moses , for this religious man who be against jew and against the soviet system , than she do for jew who be not religious . whether or not she have talk to god , she have certainly be review for he . levi , the expert on metal , would have have no difficulty in tell the	difference	between gold and tin . i have hear that he be sadden by this writing of fernanda eberstadt 's , in which he own writing be fault . two month after the herle piece be publish levi committed suicide , throw he down the staircase of the house in turin where he be bear and grow up , where he wrote about he life in the camp at a desk which stand where he cradle have stand , a house he share with he wife and mother .
levi 's double life as chemist and write suggest that if art and work need to be separat , according to a certain sense of what it be to be a jew , art and work be nevertheless very often the same . i like to think that he would have accept that art be work , that the work that free we , and be not just punishment , be art , and that anyone who use he imagination be an artist . the categorical	difference	of the modern world , between artist and other , do not come well out of he report . he chemistry be intrigue from this point of view . here be a second double life that of a scientist who be also an artist , a chemist who be also an alchemist , a businessman who be also a magician .
ronnie , i think , could be hold to be a precursor of p for patrick doyle in kelman 's novel of 1989 , a disaffection . both works end on a possible return , on what might look like a bleak diminuendo but be really an anxiety state . there be important	difference	, though . kelman stand much closer to the new hero , and very be make of what happen in that hero 's head . the new book be funny and depresse at considerable length , and there be moments when a wee terror come of it expanded universe .
everyone who want to act professionally should try to see as much drama as they possible can and this means in the broad sense , watch television , cinema , visit the theatre and look at the actor 's work careful and analytically . it be also important that you try and evaluate the dramatic experience of this different form of presentation this be worthwhile , because it will make you think about the different way in which an actor can work and the various way in which he skills be use . clearly , there be a	difference	in scale and dimension between the stage , the television scree and the cinema screen , which demand change in direction and in act technique . one of the thing you will notice when watch the television be that close - up be use very effective , and so it be of vital importance that the actor have absolute control over his/her face and expression . you should also look at the way in which the physical movement of the actor be organise to suit the restraint of the small screen .
be you say that this combination of vocal and physical train stem from the demand of the classical play , like richard iii , or do you think a different approach be need for the modern writer a s . no , i do not think so . the big	difference	be the dimension of verse , obviously , and you have to live through that differently . classical act be really quite a recent thing for i so it be a case of speak the verse as naturally as possible but observe it s rhythm and structure . a.r
this be not unnatural , as in the 1970 and early 1980s spencer be at the queen 's university , belfast , and an active member of the all child together movement . support for this line of approach have be find in greeley and rossi 's ( 1966 ) survey in the usa on the effectiveness of catholic school . base on statistical data for roman catholic educat in both roman catholic and other school , greeley and rossi note as one of they finding that there be little	difference	in adult religious practice between the two group . there be a group among form roman catholic school pupil who exhibit a much intense level of practice , but this be also child of fervent roman catholic . the causal inference adopt by greeley and rossi be that roman catholic school only have a clearly identifiable and reinforce effect on the belief and practice of this group .
this be something for which survey , include that of greeley and rossi , be not and cannot be intended . another point worth bear in mind be the very generalizing character of greeley and rossi 's study . there be nothing in the study on the	difference	between individual catholic school , either in term of pupil experience or the variety of educational practice and personnel in each school . a black - box approach to the schoole process be use with no direct investigation of process within the school . final , while it could be argue that greeley and rossi tell we something of catholic versus state school in the us , they have nothing to tell we about catholic versus christian , multi - denominational school , which be what many of the argument in ireland be about .
and goldberg in the margin : compendium of old theme . as though in every life , wrote harsnet ( and goldberg return to he type ) , if enough work have be do , enough determination show , there be one final large summary , and that should be enough . perhaps that be the	difference	, wrote harsnet , between i and someone like goldberg , for all he energy and ambition . he float with the tide . there can be no summation for he because there be nothing there to sum up .
excuse not to do the work we think we might or should do , excuse not to be kind or considerate or whatever it be we feel we should be what he want , wrote harsnet ( type goldberg ) and what i want . the	difference	be that i know what i want and he do not . though , wrote harsnet , that difference may not be as great as i sometimes imagine . for what do know mean in such case
what he want , wrote harsnet ( type goldberg ) and what i want . the difference be that i know what i want and he do not . though , wrote harsnet , that	difference	may not be as great as i sometimes imagine . for what do know mean in such case what do want mean
doubts now only the result of panic , he wrote . of the sense that perhaps everything need rethink , that perhaps next time i might get it right . that be the	difference	, he wrote , between i and goldberg , i and mcgrindle and the rest . they can always start again and it do not matter . even bacon can destroy what he do not like and start again .
the maximum of movement , he wrote , with the maximum of stillness . the maximum of passivity with the maximum of energy . the maximum of sameness with the maximum of	difference	. the maximum of silence with the maximum of noise . the maximum of significance with the maximum of insignificance .
camra fact sheet no2 unreal beer there be a vital	difference	between real ale and keg beer . keg , which include lage , be know in the industry as brewery conditioned beer . instead of a secondary fermentation in the cask to add a full , mature palate , keg beer be kill off in the brewery by a number of unnatural process that affect the taste and quality of the product .
i would like to respond to james stewart 's letter ( caterer , 2228 august ) . i , too , have be employ in the catering industry for approximately eight year and hold similar qualification to that of mr stewart . the	difference	be that i have be fortunate to find a career that i love and , what be much , get pay reasonable for it . i have always have reasonable live - in accommodation ( have inspect it before accept a position ) and , although on certain day i have work non - stop , on other i have be very quiet and still receive the same salary . i think this be a fair balance .
there be ten of thousand of chinis recipe and shade of flavour . we talk about sweet and sour but they may have five different sweet and five different sour . another key	difference	between style be in heat control , inextricable tie in with the equipment use . any standard piece of western cater equipment simply cannot produce the heat neede . that be the crucial difference in keep the flavour , say jermey , for who an important concern have be authenticity .
another key difference between style be in heat control , inextricable tie in with the equipment use . any standard piece of western cater equipment simply cannot produce the heat neede . that be the crucial	difference	in keep the flavour , say jermey , for who an important concern have be authenticity . the main difference between the two style of cuisine be in the way the chinis blend ingredient , how they introduce colou into the food , and that up to 90 % of the work be do prior to cook . import the ingredient through swholesale have not be a problem .
any standard piece of western cater equipment simply cannot produce the heat neede . that be the crucial difference in keep the flavour , say jermey , for who an important concern have be authenticity . the main	difference	between the two style of cuisine be in the way the chinis blend ingredient , how they introduce colou into the food , and that up to 90 % of the work be do prior to cook . import the ingredient through swholesale have not be a problem . the lotus leaf need to line the bamboo steamer for the szechwan dish of steame beef and rice flour be examine with interest , as be the ingredient use to make the rice flou short grain rice , cinnamon bark , star anise and special wild pepper which be then saute dry for 15 minute and ground into a semolina - type texture after the removal of the bark and anise .
it be the same with 18/8 . it be not a standard product . he also say that the nickel content do not , for all practical purpose , make any	difference	to the hardness , but that it do make it very stain resistant . so if the number be not an infallible guide to gand stainless steel cutlery , what be medlock give the follow advice : exai the finish very careful , particularly the fork .
the fact that a wide number of manufacturer work to the same pattern means that the caterer who be topp up need not return to the same source for the top - up . identify a selection of cutlery distributor , send they one of you piece of cutlery and ask they to match it and send they sample and your back . there will be some	difference	, but they may be too slight to be notice by the customer , who would normal see only one piece of each item in any case . shopp around for a top - up will allow the good price while still keep the cutlery service in the same style . one way of putte off the day of replacement be to take much care of exist cutlery .
the fact that it be over a hundred year old do not detract from it impact . just for once , a frenchie have conced that the brit do something good . the	difference	between the french and english approach to make mustard , technology apart , have not change for a century . in france , mustard seed be soak and then ground to a paste . on this side of the channel , we mill they to obtain a flour .
angel aye , that villain malign i will catch and confound with i little grey cell ! the next unarguable literary reference which agatha christie must have respond to be find in john skelton 's speke , parrot . this poem be generally agree to be make up of material from different date and there be considerable textual	difference	between manuscript version . the many tell one , from the point of view of this study , be find only as recently as 1893 in the brestimont collection . it be actual entitle speke , porot and contain the follow significant variant of the first three stanza :
she novel write ( the legacy and bella mafia ) have also be acclaim . the success in 1991 of prime suspect ( for granada , and starr helen mirren ) again bring lynda la plante 's write talent on to the screen of 17 million viewer . a police thriller with a	difference	. helen mirren play the role of detective chief inspector jane tennison who for year have be the victim of sexual discrimination in the police force . head a homicide enquiry be a prize which have always elude she , until against all the odd she be appoint to head a case .
screenings be schedule as follow : film on central for the whole of the festival period central television will be joi in and add a new screen with a	difference	. from saturday 21 september to saturday october 5th , in it late night/early morning slot , central will be screen movie with connection to the festival . for the first week the film from the urban jungle series echo the city theme of the festival , from the city and media conference to the presentation of tavernier film which celebrate the city of lyon , tavernier 's birthplace , and birmingham 's twin town .
screen and television write talk at the birmingham international film and television festival sept 20oct 5 , 1991 wednesday , 25 september , 7pm : lynda la plante , write of the successful and popular series widow , and this year 's major police drama with a	difference	, prime suspect , talk to bbc television script executive , beth porter . thursday , 26 september , 7pm : john mcgrath , founder member of 7 : 84 theatre company and write of blood r roses , the dress - maker and robin hood , talk to archer 's script write and screenwrite for zone production , mary cutler .
in time past , i have try to get across to the continent as much as possible , but now , while other people be go abroad for the first time because of all the cheap travel around , i be ( without intende to be anti - social ) do exactly the opposite and take a look around the british isle . all this did , of course , cost money , but if you have have even a comparatively small amount of that and then lose it , you do tend to realize how transient the whole thing be and not worry so much about get it back again . besides , i do not think i could now save enough to make a significant	difference	to i standard of live when i retire , so i decide i might as well enjoy it while i have the chance . in retrospect , i would probably have save a little bit very , but there it be i do manage to save a little bit anyway . i have be employ at jersey house for about two and a half year when i be approach to see if i might like to do a little clean work to earn some overtime .
it take six week for the first amount of money to arrive . the rent cheque be , to i surprise , a few pound short of the amount i be actual pay certain deduction have be make for light and other odd thing that be technically include in i monthly rent . i go to see they about this but they tell i it be up to the social security people to make up the	difference	. i go to see they as well and they tell i to fill in another form . all this begge for money be time - consum and degrad so i decide to concentrate on find work .
i do all the usual stuff i give she some money and stike she on a tube train to a night shelter , but while i be walk out of the tube station , i think to i , you complacent bitch you know . it remind i of when i use to give people money just to make they go away again . there be not an enormous	difference	, let we face it . it be ground in something very now . what should i have do
up in cooler scottish clime it 's time to start planning for winter and lay good foundation for next year 's display , say sid robertson our mountain can be very cold in late september . even in the first week of june , when potato be a foot high and oilseed rape be in glower , snow fall on high ground , and this make a	difference	to what you can grow successfully . last september i visit a garden which be nearly a thousand foot up , and i could see that the gladioli , plant as dormant corm in early may , be not go to flower . what a contrast to the beautiful gladioli grow by carole in pot .
this would certainly be hazard in a cross wind and , to an inexperience pilot , in any wind direction . in this cas the student probably rely on the instructor to make the decision and know that he be there and can save the situation if thing go wrong . it be important to make the student aware of the subtle	difference	between be safe at all time and be safe in particular condition . above all it be vital for every pilot to have the old adage safety first indelible imprint on they mind . in other word , if in doubt , do not take a chance .
this means concentrate on the tow and only take you eye off the towplane for a brief moment . rope break usually occur through inattention and get bad out of position . they be probably almost as rare as engine failure , but there be one important	difference	. with a rope break , the climb out be at the normal tow speed when the rope break , whereas when engine problem occur the tow be usually slow and the climb be far bad than normal . if the rope break , the take off field should be within easy reach for a downwind landing , whereas a problem with the towplane 's engine usually mean a field landing be almost inevitable .
stairlift normally have a weight limit of 20 stone . what if i have a curve staircase or a platform land some company make lift that fit on to curve stairway or have automatic platform that bridge the	difference	between the two step at a platform land . ask the advice of the occupational therapist ; social service will also arrange for someone to give further advice . will a stairlift obstruct the stair
the correct equipment be equally important when you be adapt you property , make sure that the bath or shaver , and w.c . that you install be suitable for you to use . this be particularly relevant if you have limit movement in you hip , shoulder or problem with you hand . a simple grab rail place in the correct place can make a considerable	difference	to how you cope , especially with the bath or toilet . remember rail in bathroom could be plastic coat or bond to prevent conduction . if you be replace exist fitment to redecorate or improve you bathroom it be advisable to consider what equipment suit you well , particularly if you be little mobile , have a disability or be elderly .
the report be certainly not a definitive and unchallengeable portrait of the metropolitan police . in late , calmer moment , that conclusion which be not base on publish research material need to be contest . there be a world of	difference	between research finding base on safe academic principle and methodology , and that produce with graphic literary phras , but base upon anecdotal heresay , record by listener bless with total recall . this attack be repeat again in 1987 in the federation magazine , for the report have obviously hit a very raw nerve . it frenzy rejection be very different to that of the many project list in the police foundation or home office register of research mention above , many of which be simply ignore and never ever receive any review .
barrie irve , the police foundation director have present a paper today outlin research into the police and criminal evidence act ( pace ) . have some 1979 data on custody practice and prison interview he sotch to replicate the study in 1986/7 to assess the influence of the legislation on police practice . claim significant	difference	in post - pace activitie he suggest this show the need for legal measure to impact upon police practice and influence change . he observational sample of priso interview , although small , have find the pace code of practice be follow to the letter and he argue this show that it require the sanction of the law to effect change in interview and interrogation technique . a detective inspector shrug this off , argue from practical mastery and insider 's knowledge , that the practice of do the business remain undisturb outside of the pace interview .
just over a year late , at a career appraisal interview with the chief constable , i be ask : tell i , how do you find the law course at the polytechnic i point out that i have not be to the polytechnic , but have be to durhbe university on a scholarship only the second the force have be award . i be then ask : what be the	difference	between a law course at polytechnic and at the university this assumption that policeman study law become axiomatic . as smith ( ibid . ) indicate , the cost of one scholarship ( when he be write in 1978 ) be about 30 , 000 and by the late 1980 this have rise to well over 100,000 .
we could purchase we own house while they live in police colony , deny the privilege of house purchase until they have fifteen year 's service ; this classify they as peasant , serf , live in the feudal world of tithed cottage . after an eight - hour shift we go home off duty free man , while they in contrast go to they police house and be available for discretional duty , at the call of the system twenty - four hour a day ; prove we be independent free man and they be slave ! all of this social	difference	be em - body in the symbol of uniform . we expensive , good - quality tunics be well cut and belt , while we guard style cap , set up at the front to emulate the officer class , make we different . helmets and unbelted tunics be for the despised county man , that sheep - dipper up the road in the stick who we continually use to reassert we own status by look on they as hicksville country cousin and definitely not real polise .
i would enter a plea that i have often make that the street officer 's authority and discretion should be give good recognition . it have always seem to i rather sad that almost any move from beat duty be regard as a promotion . such a plea , although laudable , have little chance of beco reality in the present organizational set - up , for it ignore the semantic	difference	in the uniformed poli 's role and that of the 1015 per cent of the institution who form the lite in the cid . for the uniformed wolly at the bottom of the hierarchical pile , any move into detective work can have parallel with a marginal movement . it become a rite of separation into an area where the detective 's need to juggle with statistics and detection rate be diametrically oppose to the constantle voice uniform preference for action which be simply program to nail the prig down .
it be the world of esso man ( every saturday and sunday off ) , and the real poli be scorn be reflecte in some of the language of definition which i have outlin here . now , as a consequence of i eight marginal year on a drug squad , visit to the unite nation , and the three year at university reade a subject which few know anything about , but would be will to dismiss along with all of the social science , i be in danger of be irrevocable cast into the mould of be a college man or academic . i be close to be one of they and definitely not one of we because of an acquired list of significant	difference	. give that the police be essentially an organization constrain by an ingrained respect for the pragmatism of action regardless of the lip - service pay to the police college , the special course , or the university scholarship it be inevitable that the hierarchy would follow the dictate of institutional philosophy and pull the marginal mover in from the periphery ; for there be a boundary beyond which the pilgrim cannot be allow to stray . in all the legend or tale of the journey to individuation and knowledge , the liminal mover always return to the centre and be reconstitute into structure .
i know you be in love with i , say lucy , make a neat mound of cigarette ash , firme she hand against shake , and i say it before , and i will say it here and now . i do love you . i be not in love with you there be a	difference	. yeah , think jay , as if wad through cement , let 's be semantic , let 's forget the way we eye meet , the way we body cling so hungrily together . lucy say :
the hook at this point it be necessary to distinguish between foot sweep and hooks . in fact , there be not a great deal of	difference	between the two and the one merge into the other . however , we can see a difference when we compare the two extreme form . the hook ( a ) slide back to avoid the opponent 's front kick , then hake he foot as it land
at this point it be necessary to distinguish between foot sweep and hooks . in fact , there be not a great deal of difference between the two and the one merge into the other . however , we can see a	difference	when we compare the two extreme form . the hook ( a ) slide back to avoid the opponent 's front kick , then hake he foot as it land consider the follow scenario .
this jar the opponent off balance and bring the head forward and into range of a follow punch . notice that in this example of the foot sweep , the opponent 's ankle be actual struck with the flat of you foot and be knock , rather than draw , to one side . that be the basic	difference	between the hook and the sweep though , as i say , the two do blur into one . the sweep ( a ) throw a long - range reverse punch to the opponent 's face . use this to set you hip up
( professor dudek have demonstrate that from a base of only 1.7 per cent of the population , the input in term of literature and art amount to a stagger 25 per cent . ) montreal be an unusual city , make up of 50 village which have grow and merge together over the year to form the modern conurbation : about 100 square kilometre in size ( 60 square mile ) , encircle by the st lawrence river . the various group keep a fairly sharp	difference	between they , center they activity , not little through the exigency of the two language , in they own area : essentially in the east ( french ) and west ( english which include the large scottish and other cultural element ) . so it be that the cohen 's life be very largely circumscri by the montreal riding , which have as it many prestigious centre westmount , where they live . here this very affluent neighbourhood spread out southwards and westward from the mont royale , after which the city be name .
but it be very clear that it be present , though at time it influence wax and wane . it be surely part of the ambiguity of he person , as well as of he work , whether priestly or prophetic . what , after all , be the	difference	between a priest act in the high sense of he vocation , or a prophet compell into declamation , or such a saint ( even unknow ) , open he up to the mercy of god , become a channel for they to the world one thing be certain , that that of they priest , prophet or saint who do so respond , be usually reject . not make outsider as scobie argue , but marginalise , neuter : precisely because they be too near the centre of thing ; dangerous catalyst .
imagine a scientist in the distant future who know everything about the mechanism and neurology of vision , but who be blind from birth . that there be something he do not know be show by the fact that if he be to gain he sight , he would come to know something that he previously have not know . this might be characterize as what it be like to see or what thing look like or , much especially , what colour be like ( that be , what they look like there be no	difference	in they case ) . no amount of unsighted knowledge of neuronal activity or light wave - length could amount to this . the same point can be make in a slight different way .
we cannot , therefore , leave it as an irreducible fact about different physical process that they feel different . in fact , the mode of access argument be ambiguous . it might be interpret as say that v have a mode of access to he own brain different from any mode of access to v 's brain available to bs ; or that v have a different mode of access to the external world , and that this constitute the	difference	between he and bs . it be impossible to deny that v have a different mode of access to the external world from bs , for v can see and bs cannot . but the question be how this constitute a subjective difference .
it be impossible to deny that v have a different mode of access to the external world from bs , for v can see and bs cannot . but the question be how this constitute a subjective difference . one can then choose to say either that it constitute the	difference	, simplicite . the former simply reinstate the problem of the inner feel . within the mode of knowledge framework , the feel will be explain by the special mode of access to one 's own brain .
within the mode of knowledge framework , the feel will be explain by the special mode of access to one 's own brain . that this will not do be what i have just argue . the second response , that the	difference	consist solely and simply in a mode of knowledge of the external world , without invok any internal and introspectible feel , require one to explain perceptual experience with different mode of access without reference to a subjective component . as far as i can see , the only way to do this be to adopt a behaviouristic approach to this knowledge and characterize it as an ability to discriminate visual object . to take this road be to resort to what i early descri as the much primitive physicalist response to the problem , which involve deny that there be anything about the nature of experience that bs do not know .
it be the content specifically of sense - perception that must be take non - reductive , if the contrast require by we concept of disposition be to be maintain . some philosopher might suspect that i have not consider the behaviouristic theory in they many sophisticate form . would it not make a	difference	if one identify experience , not with some disposition to overt behaviour , but with the behaviour of the brain as it discriminate the various sort of stimuli within the nervous system this be a version of the supposedly post - behaviourist theory call functionalism , which treat mental state as respond to other internal and mental state as well as to external stimuli . the first thing to notice about functionalism be that it do not fare any good than behaviourism in provide an account of what it be that v know and bs do not , for bs could know all about v 's functional or covertly behavioural state ; so there be no lack of knowledge that he deficit could consist in .
thought will be refer to as cognisant act . the simpl and many fundamental aspect of cognisance ( fundamental philosophically and developmentally ) be what be usually refer to as self - world dualism : the knowledge that there be a physical world out there of which i be an experiencer and that be distinct from i . mental development , on the constructivist view , consist in the elaboration of this knowledge ; so that if there be one central	difference	between the mental process of the baby , the child , and of the adult it be in terms of how self - world dualism be manif in ( and to ) the subject . the representational theory of mind treat the explanation of mental life as a kind of engineere problem ; it start from the inside , from the representational state , and ask how mental state interact with one another to produce something that we would call knowledge ; the representational theorist proceed like a sceptical philosopher who think that what figure in we mental life be not reality but we mental representation of it ( recall i say the fodor descri he position as methodological solipsism ) . the constructivist start - point could not be very different , and might be say to be biological where the representational theory be engineere or machinological .
consider then , an organism in a world of inanimate object . ( there be a lot to be say about the role of other person too , but i be leave that out for the time be . ) there be three crucial	difference	between the organism and the object . ( 1 ) it can move it and have biological need ( not just for food and warmth and the like , but the need to use it faculty functionlust as it be once call by a german psychologist ) . ( 2 ) it have input system .
it mean that we can think about thing that be not present . sure enough , we would expect the input system to ensure that the right kind of distinction be draw between contou change that define occlusion and that which define disappearance , for example but this sure do not mean that the possessor of this input system be capable of think about unperceive entity . what this add up to , then , be the claim that if there exist an organism which either could not act or who action make no	difference	to it perception then not only would that organism not be cognisant , it could never become cognisant . ( it be not clear to i whether this be some kind of philosophical claim or an hypothesis . you may say that it be refutable and so it be empirical ; but then see below we criterium for cognisance be so much bind up with what the subject can do that it be difficult to see how we could assess the cognisance of a totally passive creature . )
the point of the experiment be this : strong social pressure be be put on this child to agree to a realist answer ( they be not allow out of the room until they have an answer ! ) and if they usual tendency to interpret question phenomenally be a trivial and weak effect then this social pressure should obliterate it . the result be that the social pressure have no effect at all . in child between four and eight year of age there be absolutely no	difference	between the number of realist answer produce by the pair and by the control , solo child . they know the realist option but do not take it as a way out of a social impasse , because , i would argue , the phenomenalist tendency of think be too strong . what dominate they judgement be the salience of the illusion that be many up front in consciousness .
where will the child now point if he point to the empty box then it be probably fair to regard this as deliberate misinform , as the implant of a false belief in another 's mind . in fact we do find a clear	difference	between the three - and the four - year - old : the young one typically point to the box with the chocolate and the old child to the empty box . but what be strike about the three - year - old 's behaviour here be that they do this for twenty trial . they could see that the competitor 's pile of chocolate grow ever higher and that they be winn nothing , and yet they be powerless to do anything about it !
initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually lose inter and start to look away ( habituation ) ; if the stimulus be then change in some way and if this caus a re - awaken of interest ( dishabituation ) then we can assume that the baby have detect the change . another technique be preferential look . if the subject prefer to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he have detect a	difference	between they . 8 . this idea have a great influence upon the think of schopenhauer who follow up it implication very thorough than do kant . 9 .
the problem be that it be high improbable that a group of patient with brain injury constitute a natural kind , even when they display similar symptoms on some test or other . this be because no two patient be likely to have identical injury , and large group of patients be even less likely to be homogenous . in fact , if you probe deeper , vitally important functional	difference	between patient will emerge . in amnesium , as in many other so call neuropsychological syndrome ( developmental dyslexium , schizophrenium , wemicke be aphasia etcetera ) there be probably no uniform pattern in nature wait to reveal it . what you have be group of people who display superficially similar symptoms for a variety of different reason .
it be know as a speech output system because there be evidence that a quite separate lexicon be involve in speech perception . a pronunciation be address either with or without the mediation of the semantic system we store of word meaning . the fundamental	difference	between the two route , then , be that a pronunciation be either buil up from sublexical component ( assemble phonology ) or look up as a whole ( address phonology ) . this model have be extremely successful in enabl we to understand acquired dyslexium . acquire dyslexia involve a loss of read ability as a result of brain injury .
moreover , a closer look at individual patient provide support for what be say about the heterogeneity of group at the start of this section . so , the much that surface dyslexics be study , the much it become obvious that the condition fractionate ; there be important difference between individual surface dyslexics . this	difference	can also be accommodate by the dual route model . for example , one surface dyslexic can accuratele define the irregular word that he regularize in pronunciation tasks ( for instance , pronounce colonel as col - oh - nell ) . he probley be therefore at the level of the speech output lexicon .
i have go into such detail about individual patients to try to convince you first , that it can be mislead to categorize patients too narrow into group , and second , that the dual - route model i descri can accommodate a wide variety of data from different individual case . there be an equally important additional point that i want to make . since brain damage can produce this very precise	difference	between patient , it be difficult to avoid the conclusion that there be one part of the brain that have the precise function of carry out each piece of information process that be specify within the cognitive model . it seem to i to be perverse in the extreme to attempt to resist the claim that the brain be literal carry out this function . cognitive neuropsychology thus provide powerful evidence that the level of analysis which functionalist use to describe brain process be the correct one .
although neither have be cit directly in the text , the philosophical idea in this chapter have be heavily influence by the work of jerry fodor and zenon pylyshyn . fodor ( 1981 ) provide a very clear description of functionalism , and he book the modularity of mind discuss some of the philosophical issue surround cognitive neuropsychology . pylyshyn ( 1984 ) contain an important account of the relationship between cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence , and pylyshyn ( 1973 ) contain an interesting discussion of the	difference	between cognitive science and phenomenology . a very clear introduction to current work in cognitive neuropsychology be provide by ellis and young ( 1988 ) . churchland 's matter and consciousness be an equally lucid introduction to the philosophy of mind .
the lack of explanatory force of neurophysiological and psychophysical observation be explicitly admitt by some scientist . it have be well express by the biologist richard dawkin : the sensation of see be for we very different from the sensation of hear , but this cannot be directly due to the physical	difference	between light and sound . both light and sound be , after all , translate by the respective sense organ into the same kind of nerve impulse . it be impossible to tell , from the physical attribute of a nerve impulse , whether it be convey information about light , about sound or about smell .
he assert , rather cryptically , that it be because we internally use we visual information and we sound information in different way and for different purpose that the sensation of see and hear be so different . it be not directly because of the physical	difference	between light and sound this be not a very convince escape from the circularity of the psychophysical laws . on the contrary , it expose the explanatory weakness of the muller doctrine , if it be offer as an advance in we understand of the origin of different modality of sensation , of why the world feel as it do ; and , even very , if it be offer as an account of we be able to feel the world at all .
if it ever do , it be always as a part which be apart , separate , a precious stone set in the silver sea . a scepter isle ! neela be aware of this	difference	. but what do this difference mean to neela or rather how do it feel
by that time i be hopeless lose and hopelessly bore . perhaps because this be the first time i be all alone in a big city in a new country . i have always have someone to go round with , while in europe , or in america ; and good company , any company , can make an enormous	difference	to one 's perception of whatever one happen to be perceive . and london be different . i have get so use to the straight criss - cross north - south , east - west road of many american city that i would have to acquire a taste for the much complex and possibly much very fascinate spread of london lane .
who bland do you think it be really maybe it be a recent murder after all . it be a stupid idea but nothing she say seem to make any	difference	. she want to say screw the colonialist blood but do not . she keep wait for he to do something , but he hesitate , as if he be wait for she .
engel also believe in the myth of a new society which could be mould in a sensible modern way , without feudal tradition or appendage . the buddeke , however , be to win . eleanor make note on the	difference	between english and american workplace and union . corporation , bank and trust control a great deal and , although machine replace sworke very frequently in america , certain trade , eleanor wrote , be 50 per cent very labour intensive than in england . american labour politics be complicate and deem a slippery business by engel .
some mim dance and twirl around he , humm popular song . little do they know this be the fellow for who the flippity flop young man be write , and i be not about to tell they . would it have make any	difference	if i have do he enjoy be a temporarily anonymous spectacle , or do he believe this seamstress and pipe fitter know who he be i could not quite tell , and as a sort of curator of the afternoon , it make i nervous .
for i it be like an aladdin 's cave , and one could not help but notice the often ridiculously low price be ask . much of this be own label merchandise of course , but occasionally one would come across a familiar branded item , at about half the price of that at home . the	difference	be compound even far with the consideration that american pay - rate be two or three time ours . if we cannot beat the system , how can we get it to work for we i have have some modest success in this regard , and pass on here some tip i have use .
the thickness would suit a guitar but be unnecessarily heavy for a dulcimer less than half it width . soundpost be an important feature of bow instrument but be unsuitable for pluck instrument and will deae the sound of a dulcimer . try compare a pluck note on a violin and on a mandolin and you will certainly notice the	difference	. if the post be only intended to curve the back , this can be good achieve by plan a curve on to the strut before they be glue to the back . it be possible to make dulcimer of different size and shape but this do affect the sound produce .

one memory will certainly be of the running of far much steam train than seem possible in the seventy , not all of they successful the gwr 150 special , the blackmuch vale , cambrian coast , cumbrian mountain and regular for some season into scarborough and over the west highland . while ordinary motive power generally become very standardise , and again as tell late in this page the	difference	between locomotive - haule and multiple - unight stock less mark , the variety still remain impressive and just as many notebook and camera record the passage of train at the end as at the begin of the eighty . livery have of course proliferate ; not since pre - 1923 day have so many different colour scheme be see , the only snag be that often two or very livery be include in the same train where for example the pte 's dedicate stock get divert . much of the semaphore of 1980 have go , virtually no large gantry remain in total use .
the locomotive be see here pass stonebridge , durham work the 17.29 heaton carriage siding in york , with the stock for the yorkcardiff postal service , on 10 june 1988 . gwrlivery class 50 no 50007 sir edward elgar originally hercules , rename in 1984 ) haul a nse service , near pirbright junction on 29 july 1989 . the 14.20 king 's crossleed intercity service pull away from wakefield westgate on 25 april 1989 power by a class 91 no 91008 note the	difference	in profile between the mk3 stock and the mk4styled locomotive . memory of the 1950s chairman sir peter parker be do he good , but the 1980 opened with much the same worry of insecurity over government policy , lack of investment , and work practice which hark back to the old company rule .
under the chairmanship of sir peter parker the concept of the commercial railway and the social railway be develop at the end of the 1970 and the start of the 1980 . the first be to be run on strictly business line , while the second neede financial support . this emphasise not only the importance of the distinct type of business but the	difference	between the business and the operation . so on 4 january 1982 the railway 's commercial undertak be divide into it separate element . freight and parcel have always be see as distinct entity , and this naturally form two of the new sector .
the good example of this have be the deployment of the hst fleet . this be first buy in the 1970 by the region , but it have be deploy under sectorisation with singleminded determination to maximise earning . yet while intercity be suppose to be one business , offer consistent standard throughout britain , many regional	difference	in what the traveller actual experience die slowly . it be now the sector which sponsor investment in track and signall as well as roll stock , that must deal with the modernisation of stations , and so on . the decision be commercial : what will earn the good return on the investment
the extension of electrification from bournemouth to weymouth , complete in 1988 , see the arrival of the new streamlin 100mph class w2 , fivecar buffet unit with power - operate slide door , air condition , and the return of compartment for first - class traveller . the traditional southernwaste not , want not policy be perpetuate in the reuse of traction equipment from the class 432 4 - reps they replace . intercity 's dedicate victoria - gatwick express push - pull service launch in 1984 make little	difference	to domestic service , employ ex - lmr mark 2f coach form into trail set with a 1959 - type 2 - hap drive trailer convert to a drive van at one end , and a class 73 locomotive at the other . much thorough stock control complete the changed southern scene as virtually all emu unit be renumber to allow the first two digit to match they fleet status . the london midland region , the only operator of wholly dc unit , cut it variety to just three .
the example be not always abstract ballet , because the three aspect descri above be applicable to many choreography if music and dance be to be equal partner in a ballet . how ashton reflect the period and quality of the music a study of five ashton ballet show that all be base on classical technique , despite they apparent	difference	. each reflect something of the period and quality of the music , the period be of the time when write by the composer or when present as a ballet and the quality be that inspire in the choreographer by the composer . symphonic variation ( 1947 )
this be somethe that ashton emphasise when natalia , kolia , vera and the tutor dance to chopin 's grande polonaise and fantasy on polish air in a month in the country . it be this careful attention to traditional dance rhythm which be so important to the style of both ballet , although neither can be call a character or national work ( see page 28 ) . schoreographe can make subtle	difference	between dance to a waltz , mazurka or polonaise and there be contrast rhythm to be find in a /34 ; time signature . another way of accente it be the so - call six temps , that be , two bar with six strong beat . this be a favourite rhythm fur male solo use particularly by nineteen - century balletmaster .
this dance matter very much to petipa and all nineteenthcentury balletmaster because they be expect to show off the wealth of talent find in the many imperial , royal and state theatre , e.g . all the character from other fairy tale who come to aurora 's wedding and the character dance in swan lake . mim dance and dance mime however , the strict division of a ballet into four distinct kind be eliminate by fokine when he totally cut the scne d'action from he first ballet and never replace they . instead , he use what he call mim dance or dance mime , insist , when ask fur an explanation , that there be a subtle	difference	between they , only one of degree . to fokine , l sylphide be mim dance because he have incorporate a few conventional gesture into he choreography . fokine say that every phrase of he dance be a gesture , and explain : undoubted an arabesque have many meaning but only when it appear as an idealised gesture .
the scene between hilarion , giselle , albrecht and bathilde be reminiscent of the scene that develop tybalt 's hatr of romeo from the first fight between montague and capulet to he discovery of romeo with juliet after they first meet at the ball , and final to the fight that end in tybalt 's death . this scene height the tension and suggest that all will end in tragedy . despite the great	difference	in style between the above three ballet and despite they different libretti the three choreographer perrot ( with saint - georg ) , macmillan and ashton give valid reason why the tragic deaths of giselle , romeo and juliet , and natalia 's lost love be the inevitable result of what have go before . in other word , what happen at the begin of the story state why the relationship between two or very character lead to confrontation which continue onwards to a climax and final draw the ballet to a suitable conclusion . this last task be possibly the much difficult because the audience must be convince that the ending chosen be the only possible outcome of everything that have go before .
the cold air be make even very apparent by the swift footwork when the entire cast jump light upwards away from the ground . admitted the dcor and light help to create the illusion of changing season . but if ashton have not make this very distinctive change in he port de bra , the seasonal	difference	would not have be so notable . the above example be only a few of that show how conventional port de bra can be change . a study of ashton 's way of use they , or of macmillan 's , reveal how unnecessary it be to keep pass the arm through 1st position .
the hornpipe be not exclusive to england , which many seem to think , even though petipa in he ballet the daughter of pharaoh include a hornpipe to represent the thames in a spectacular scene where the four great river of the world meet under the sea . each country with a saile history have it own version which differ only slight from that of other . the	difference	lie in the rhythm of the pipe tune to which it be dance . but much very can be make out of it well - recognise movement . a particularly fine example be that design by de valois for the sailor in the rake 's progress .
this can rough be classify as come from work , hobby and pastime . the activity involve may be heavy or light or something with a specialised technique . for example , there be a very great deal of	difference	between saw a large log by hand and stitch , or between play a game of tennis and a game of card . embroidery require a specialised technique , so do ice skat . in decide to use a particular occupational process in he design a choreographer have four consideration :
the events and circumstance surround such plot be difficult to control and organise because the character be supposed live in the real world . so the choreographer cannot make strong contrast between the style usually use for the other - worldly spirit and that use for the character live in the particular setting . he can only highlight the atmosphere support the plot , especially tho circumstance where he have to portray	difference	between class and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasy , etc . , for example the contrast that must be make between the dance for all and sundry in the town square and that for the aristocrat in the ballroom of romeo and juliet . nevertheless every choreographer create this kind of romantic ballet today have to spend much time create the proper gesture to replace the word , which in such ballet be never speak but must be understand . if the dancer perform that gesture with feel and understand they will express the mood , emotion and action of the character they play .
natural emotional expression because the character of a month in the country , enigma variation , romeo and juliet , the invitation and mayerling be supposed live in a real world , the choreographer have no need to make many deliberate contrast in the style of dance . certainly there be a	difference	between class when , fur example , the tutor dance first with katia the servant , and then with natalia in a month in the country or when townspeople dance in the street and noble in the ballroom in romeo and juliet . nevertheless much much attention have to be give to the port de bra of all type of character in such ballet because this supply the word not speak in dance . lf the port de bra be to be convince , choreographer need to study natural emotional expression .
they have to be very specific about the traditionally accept form of behaviour , customs , occupation and particular national characteristics . it be the impact of the polovtsian warrior and they dance from prince igor ( 1910 ) that startle parisian and other audience into recognition that even the much barbaric dance have a rightful place in the theatre . the	difference	between character dance and dance of character a distinction must be make between character dance and dance of character . it be first make by dauberval when stage la fille mal garde .
in thorough systematise form it now apply throughout the ussr . much of the syllabus have become part of the training of dancer all over the world . it feature be very much the same as that descri early in connection with demi - caractre style ( see page 93 ) but with a very strong	difference	. the step be always perform in boot or heel shoe so ali the movement look strong and often heavy . they require accurate time and neat footwork of the accent be to be hear and see .
in some old dance they each hold a corner of a handkerchief to form a link and in some area they link little finger . italian there be little to distinguish between the italian character dance and it demi - caractre form save only that heeled shoe be wear and thus from time to time take on a slight spanish flavour , the only	difference	perhaps be the much fluid way of phrase and less rigidly accurate time of the step . for all they liveliness of style any of the above national dance see in one ballet resemble that in another because choreographer such as petipa , bournonville and saint - lon utilise the same step and port de bra again and again . only the music create slight difference and this not marked because the composer use the good of common recognise traditional musical idiom .

the author of the report , john spicer and philip morrisey , say the result be that customer perceive beer price as rise continuously , beer be no long consider good value for money . the price freeze introduce by many regional brewer far damage the reputation of the big brewer , they add . tesco 's , with it recent price promotion , have highlight the price	difference	between home consumption and that in a pub , state the report . it also warn that the legislation that follow the monopoly and merger commission report in 1989 have be a flop . there be now no much choice , competition or low price .
much of it have be prove wrong . on the face of it , the friend 3 seem the model little likely to benefit from flexibility the thick stem interfere little with the work of the cam , both design have the same strength rate and there be only a few gram difference in weight between they . yet a flexible stem make such a	difference	; horizontal placement , angle placement , pocket , all gobble up by it voracious cam . certainly i wire be yet to get bent and distort with use the real durability test of any flexible camm device . but , have use a number of different twin stem unit i have find the single wire stem much much versatile , although sometimes a little harder to remove from stubborn placement .
one of i sister get quite hysterical when i do it to she , so mum have to give she a good shake ! one day they come to take we away , say it would be good for we what do they know we hy but it make no	difference	, they still find we . we be take to this orphanage kind of place , separat , and put into little room . we do not like the food , we prefer mum 's .
nature have follow art . danilov , the voice observe , have probably not even begin to contemplate he murder when dostoevsky be shape raskolnikov 's . the two cas be lay side by side , and likeness and	difference	be solemnly analys as if we have here before we two real , directly comparable object . all this bring joy to the novelist . he often speak to strakhov of he pride as an author in he creative foreshadow of fact , and to a . n . maikov he enlarge :
for he be an eternal traveller . as well as a rug he take a book , author and title unspecify ; the eternal traveller be also the eternal student , and it be as the student that verkhovensky first appear in the manuscript draft . from the start , as in crime and punishment , dostoevsky be project a theoretical murderer , the	difference	be that raskolnikov be an ex - student , only potentially an eternal student , because in the event he get pull back out of theory into live life . murder bring raskolnikov to see that he do not believe he reason for committ it . now the other young man never believe any of he profess and contradictory reason in the first place .
the epileptic make a neat reply , again touche life and art simultaneously : the author and hero of the idiot . i have in mind the experience of be sudden thrust outside time , which constitute in the idiot and elsewhere the epileptic aura . when this and the regeneration/resurrection theme be bring to bear upon the remark about bazarov and the 1840 , what seem a	difference	of degree turn out to be one of a kind . the criticism of turgenev be only incidentally that he be stick in the 1840 and not far - sighte enough . new - sightedness , the timeless standpoint , hitherto unknown reality this have an air of mystical hubris when drag into the open , but they be what dostoevsky be really talk about .
as an additional benefit , the closed magnetic circuit of a toroidal core great reduce the drive requirement to produce saturation level , simplify the circuitry need by the system . it may be feel that replace two straight core with a r structure be too drastic a change to gloss over , but the mechanism be not too different in the two case . figure 9 represent the way in which the line of force be concentrate from the immediate vicinity and make plausible the idea that an overwound coil would not see much	difference	in the flux change it experience from either system . an additional advantage of the ring core be that it will accept much than one overwound pickup coil and they have different orientation to the external magnetic field . for example while the coil orientation show in fig . 10a produce the large output , that 10b links none of the changing flux and have a null output .
page description language a much advance approach to page description be to design a software language which can be use to control the processor of a display device . it may be difficult to define a formal distinction between this and the page description format descri above , but a glance at the result make the	difference	obvious . compare the set of escape sequence in the previous section with fig . 7 , which show a fragment of the postscript language . the difference be clear .
it may be difficult to define a formal distinction between this and the page description format descri above , but a glance at the result make the difference obvious . compare the set of escape sequence in the previous section with fig . 7 , which show a fragment of the postscript language . the	difference	be clear . postscript be recognisable as something which can be write and read by we human . it be not the easi language to learn , but it have structure and legibility .
input z can be use as a summ input . when use as a squarer , x and y be in parallel , the differential input give polarity information ( negative output if either of the input be reverse ) . for low input , a feedback attenuator compensate for the reduce output ; the	difference	- of - square circuit in fig . 3 , for example , use the attenuator to cancel the factor of 2 loss in gain cause by the sum term generation . figure 4 , an rm - to - dc converter , also use the difference - of - square function . the filter be an integrator , it input be zeroe by the feedback loop when ( formula provide ) .

in certain respect , what hawkes call the new new criticism have what look like connection with the old version . both be directe towards the formalist reading of literary text , and some anglophone academics try to minimize the strangeness of french import by say that la nouvelle critique be only offer a new version of what have long be familiar in the anglo - american academy . this assumption ignore great	difference	in contextual form of life and conceptual foundation . nevertheless , lodge be able to use classical structuralism and aspect of russian formalism to refine and extend the exist approach of formalist criticism . resemblance be apparend between northrop frye 's system of archetype and structuralism ; indeed , hawkes refer , without qualification , to frye 's anatomy of criticism as a classic of north american structuralism .
hawkes , in turn , give the book a mockingly dismissive review in the tls , without mention nuttall 's accusation against he . nuttall , like thurley , write with a polemical edge , but both of they present they case in a serious philosophical fashion . what emerge from recent counter - theory be that french - inspire theory tend to destroy straw man in it attack on reference , insist that the relation between word and meaning be entirele arbitrary , a matter of	difference	only . the point have be frequently make that there be no necessary reason why dog should mean the familiar , faithful , bark , domestic quadrup , which in other language , get refer to as chien , hund , cane , etc . and within the language - system of english , the sound and letter of d - o - g be recognizable as such simply because they be not d - i - g , or d - o - n , or l - o - g .
he do not intend to exclude reality . the error lie with saussure 's expositor . schole , however , believe that saussure be he inconsistent , and responsible for late confusion , but the thrust of he argument be very close to tallis 's , and both of they be concern as be thurley and nuttall to reinstate the validity of reference and to deny that language be a system of pure	difference	, without relation to reality . scholes provide a useful table , divide into three column , show how linguist and philosopher have agreed in make a tripartite division between signifier , signify , and reference , though they present it in a variety of terminology . for frege , it be expression , sense , reference ( ausdruck , sinn , bedeuting ) .
in principle it would be quite possible for the study of english poetry to begin in a similar ab initio fashion , except that it would be fruitless for someone to embark on it who do not have at little some familiarity with poetry and a wish to read very . this be because the study of poetry as poetry rather than as historical or cultural material be a matter of intuitive and affective response , not just of willingness to accept an intellectual discipline , as might be the case with philosophy , economic , and so for . ( i gran that the	difference	be not absolute , and there may be element of the affective and the intuitive in the pursuit of any intellectual discipline , but they be likely to be marginal . ) it could be a reward form of teach to help an uninformed but well - motivate student to come to terms with poetry , but it would involve time and leisure . the student would need to read as wide as possible in different kind of poetry , to learn something about literary history , genre , and convention , and to acquire the practical - critical skills of close reade .
to see this activity as represent the apotheosis of morris zapp and the eclipse of phillip swallow be tempt but too simple . british version of zapp be probably now in america anyway , find a proper market - base reward for they talent and energy . american professionalism may be the ideal , but	difference	between the british and american academic system be noticeable . the great spread of american high education mean that , proportionate to population , there be far much university , all with english department ; if they be as proportionately numerous in britain , we would have about 1 , 000 university . hence the wide and generally understand variation in academic calibre between american university .
and , little definable , there be the cultural nationalism , the concept of englishness that , from the begin , have be a major element in the subject . it produce a mystique which obstruct total professionalism and separate british from american attitude . yet despite this	difference	, english english have go quite a long way down the road of a much - or - less americanize professionalism , as identify and reject in the 1960 by leavis , lewis , and gardner . from the point of view of that who be currently in charge of high education , english must be an awkward subject . it be popular , in demand , and cheap .
raymond william come to think that a split of the discipline be increasingly likely , since cultural materialism and radical semiotics be not compatible with the dominant paradigm of literary study : for this necessarily include the paradigm it as a matter for analyse , rather than as a govern definition of the object of knowledge . in this situation , the question have to be raise : can a radical different work still be carry on under a single heading or department when there be not just diversity of approach but very serious and fundamental	difference	about the object of knowledge ( despite overlapp of the actual material of study ) for reasons which be much very pragmatic than ideological , i have come to think that a separation of cultural study from english , though not easy , would be the little damage way forward for both party . it would represent a realignment within the humanity , not a diminution of they .
newbolt be attitude be still very common not only among the british ( especially tho who have come under the influence of f . r leavis ) , but also among american free versifier who think they be an avantgarde and who be muddle enough to think that they have pound 's authority to back they . whether they know it or not , they be in fact endorse henry newbolt against pound ! all the same , there be by and large a crucial	difference	here between british and american attitude , and one that be today every bit as mark as it be in 1912 . for on nearly every american campus there be an atelier in the shape of a creative write programme , whereas on no british campus be there any such thing , and indeed the british scoff at the mere possibility on precisely the ground that newbolt here put forward . pound 's exasperate bewilderment before the spectacle of british loyalty to the amateur , and british readiness to pay the price in tolerance of the amateurish , be nowhere so evident as in he lifelong esteem for laurence binyon , the editor of the hewlett letter .
fire have to consume to give off it light . but light get it knowledge and have it intelligence and it be by go over thing without the necessity of eat the substance of thing in the process of purchase it truth . maybe this be the	difference	, the different base of not just this two poet , bill and ep , but something very , two contrary conception of love . anyway , in the present context , it serve to characterize two different personal via : one achieve it clarity by way of charita , the other go about it business blind , achieve it clarity by way of what you might call confusio . and this would be the point from which to look back at olson , as catherine seelye want we to , and to regard the maximus poem as embody the way of confusio .
this be what pound could never have say . when , infrequently , he want to write in some simple metre , he do so ; but when very often he want to get away from standard metre , he leave they behind altogether , no ghost of they lurk behind he arra . the	difference	between the two poet correspond ( not quite exactly , because the nature and history of french verse differ so great from english ) to the distinction that the french make between ver libre and ver libr ; between , we may say , free verse and freed verse . eliot 's practice , as he remark just quote make clear , be always free verse : verse freed indeed from the constraint of traditional prosody , yet rather constant recall to the reader 's ear one of the traditional pattern it be depart from . ( hence , notable in gerontion , eliot 's ability to approximate and even conform to jacobean blank verse , yet to depart from it smooth when he please . ) pound 's verse on the contrary be , at little after homage to sextus propertius , free , not freed : the rhythm that he sotch and attain either have never appeare before in the language , or else have not appeare there for many century .
thus pound be quite ready , and become eager , to deliver a message , though with much obliquity and delay than the impatiently moralistic reader could see reason for ; whereas eliot , true to he inheritance from french symbolisme , be sceptical and chary of convey in poetry any message at all . ( pound have study some of the same french poet , notable laforgue and rimbaud , but he have profit by they in a quite different way from eliot , and he be averse to the central thrust of the symboliste endeavour , to which indeed the imagist or imagiste movement which he have sponsore have be intended as a challenge alternative . ) the	difference	between the two of they show up in the waste , land draft . for among the rather few objection by pound that eliot pay no attention to be one or two which would have require he to make consistent , in term of locality and historical period , some of he reference to london life . eliot seem to have ignore this suggestion because for he the physical and social landscape of london be no much than a screen on which to project a phantasmagorium that express he own personal disorder and desperation ( partly sexual , as one might expect , and as the draft make clear ) ; whereas pound seem to have suppose that the subject of the poem be london in all it historical and geographical actuality , much as the city of dublin be from one point of view the subject of joyce 's ulysses .
pound seem to have no interest in that . be it not the case that george herbert and christina rossetti and even lionel johnson be devoutly christian poet , whereas pound be militantly non - christian and if pound so blithely overlooks that	difference	, do not that mean that we have in he a critic who attend to form , to style , at the expense of what that form and that style be use so as to convey do not we have in he a formalist , in fact an aesthete this be the brickbat that have be throw at pound from the first , and be throw at he still , because of he unswerve attention to what make poetry poetry , and not some other sort of discourse versify .
ivor stanbrook , mp for orpington , who chair the conservative backbench constitutional affair committee and be an anglican , say : the ill of society be as much the responsibility of the church as of political party . the archbishop should be thorough ashame of he at the failure of the effort of the church to create a good society . despite they	difference	, the philosophie of the two main political party in britain can be support quite sincerely by christian . frank field , labour mp for birkenhead and also an anglican , say dr runcie be right to attack government police but he should also direct he attention to the church , which be self - righteousness on stilt . support come from one unlikely quarter , peter bottomley , the northern ireland minister .
have devote much of he political life to tour constituency and union branch , he have barely need to campaign for the constituency section of the executive over the past two month . when mr prescott first back off stand against roy hattersley for the deputy leadership last year , and then change he mind and decide to contest it after all , neil kinnock express unrestrained irritation . but the pair , openly hostile by the end of last year , will patch up they mutual	difference	. mr kinnock will want mr prescott 's national executive support and may sometimes even need he constructive criticism . mr prescott be unquestionable closer to a large swathe of the rank and file than many other member of labour 's shadow cabinet .
we shall have four - yearly convention you can drop you resolution and buy balloon ; because that be all you will be able to release when you come to this convention . he and mr skinner urge a future labour government to give that not pay the poll tax an amnesty . and the party chairman deride the	difference	between neil kinnock and bryan gould , the trade and industry spokesman , on the value of water industry share . let 's tell they we be go to take they back without compensation . he add : the whole balance of the party be be move away from the conference and the nec to the shadow cabinet .
diego maradona do much to restore napoli to the top , create headed goal ( 18 and 45 min ) for andrea carnevale and score a virtuoso third ( 84 ) . inter 's treble come from lothar matthaus ( 26 , 39 ) and andrea brehme ( 51 ) . in spain real madrid now lead on goal	difference	from atletico madrid and sevilla after a 4 - 1 win over cadiz , hugo sanchez score two and bernd schuster one . basque nationalism surface during athletic bilbao 's match against atletico . demonstrator invade the pitch , but they be repell and play continue .
both prelate refer to the consecration in february of the rt rev barbara harris as the anglican assistant bishop of massachussett . bishop harris be quite unacceptable to the vatican . the pope say : events in recent year have serious aggravate the	difference	between we . the independent have learnt that 1 , 800 american roman catholic nun wrote last winter to dr runcie , urg he to defy the pope over the ordination of woman . sister margaret traxler , of the national coalition of american nun , say that she have tell dr runcie : the roman catholic church say this be a deterrent to unity ; but we say , how can this be a deterrent to unity when discrimination against woman be evil
be charitable , this could be consider ongoing profit , but what be to be make of sandhurst marketing tootal buy sandhurst in 1986 for 21.7m , and sell it in july for a mere 4.38m . however , rather than realise a 17m loss , tootal 's figure show a 3.4m profit , with many of the	difference	write off early through the balance sheet . sandhurst , which have perform dreadfully under tootal 's control , make a 2m loss up to the point when wh smith be persuade to buy it , and three out of the four ongo tootal business show disappoint result . the exception be cloth , which buck the trend of the rest of the uk textile industry partly because it supply marks spencer , and partly because it make very little in the uk .
if we do it properly any spot be the right spot , he insist . stack emission of pcb be below the american standard for breath air - 1 , 000 time low than the british equivalent . regular soil and grass test show no	difference	between pcb contamination in the immediate area and elsewhere in wales though there be no establish safe level for this . five air - monitor plant have be install ( he take i to see they ) . and here be drums of chemical , each labell , each with a job number to check against sampl .
in a large , prefabricate shed we wander past stack of 45 - gallon drum of pcb , two drum high , about 10 deep ; and there be contaminate transformer wait to be cut up and roast in the flame . back along the waste chain , the liverpool docker who object to the import of exactly this type of chemical should be aware that pcb be move about we road all the time . there be no	difference	between the liquid in this drum and the liquid in the cargo they refuse to touch . in liverpool , a docker 's spokesman with the transport and general worker union admit : sdrive be not happy handle some of this commodity , but at little a lorry - driver have much idea of what he be handle than a docker , who could have a consignment and just not know what it be . yet he do not oppose all toxic waste movement ( after all , the same union represent worker at rechey it ) ; he simply do not like the idea that big industrial nation like canada could dump they dirty problem on this country and he member .
ice hockey : wasps find it tough go to the top by steve pinder only goal	difference	see durham wasps reach the top of the england north table and qualify for home and away game against cardiff devil , runaway winner of the southern league . the winner will meet the scottish champion , murrayfield racer in the final in two month 's time , write steve pinder . the england north league be always the tightest with , in theory , four of the five team all able to finish top right up to the weekend 's match .
in a statement to stock exchange in london and paris yesterday morning , eurotunnel say : in that circumstance , the bank technical adviser produce a high cost estimate for the current bank case . we and the banks be agree that this be not an appropriate basis for further finance . eurotunnel , which be already in default of it credit agreement with the bank , have in effect be give until the end of the year to settle it	difference	with the contractor to permit a viable financ strategy to be put in place . if agreement cannot be reach , the bank , which include national westminster and midland , have the power to close the project or bring in fresh management . last night alastair morton , the british co - chairman of eurotunnel , say the bank could be drive to this by sheer exasperation through lack of progress in the talk .
this would involve raise an extra 1.2bn to 1.6bn . of this , 25 per cent would come from a share issue in 1990 or 1991 and new bank borrowing . however , a number of essential	difference	between eurotunnel and transmanche link need to be resolve . this include agreement on curb the cost of terminal and equipment where the contactor 's estimate be 382m high than that of eurotunnel . mr prescott 's demand for the tunnel to be take into public ownership go beyond exist labour party policy .
this be tough than it first look as it do not cover news , sport , game - show or teletext service . under british and west german pressure , however , minister agree that even this requirement should be regard very as a political objective than a legal obligation ( the non - respect of which would lead to prosecution in the ec court of justice ) . the minister reach they agreement despite linger	difference	over the toughness of the text . in the event , denmark and belgium be alone in vote against . france , meanwhile , would have like tough quota , while britain want no import limit at all .
toxic waste monitor row settle by richard north , environment correspondent the two protagonist in one of the lon - run and much bitter row about the conduct of britain 's toxic waste disposal industry settle they	difference	yesterday . rechey international , a major chemical incineration firm , and torfaen borough council in gwent , south wale , agree in an out of court settlement that a temporary injunction obtain by the company should be lift . rechey also agree to drop it request for a judicial review into torfaen 's monitoring of contamination supposed cause by the firm , and of it publication of the result .
i mother smack i . i smack i child . the	difference	be that she never feel guilty about it , whereas i , who have devoure baby and child book since i first pregnancy test be positive , do . i feel guilty because the current childcare expert tell i that in the word of penelope leach ( psychologist and author of the classic baby and child ) smack be wrong . that it be a short - cut to nowhere .
the message behind the report be that the majority of parent have get it all wrong . the research , carry out over 30 year by the joint director of the child development research unit at nottingham university , show that two - third of baby be smack before the age of one , that three - quarter of four - year - old be smack once a week or very , and that by the age of seven , 22 per cent have be hit with implement . by the age of seven ,	difference	between boy and girl have emerge , with boy be very likely to be smack once a week than girl . the report have be publish by approach ( the association to protect all children ltd ) , a new charity link to epoch ( end physical punishment of child ) , a national campaign which be launch in april . when i read the epoch literature i be always convince by it .
it be absolute piffle to say that smack child teach they that use violence be ok . there be two kind of violence good or bad . it be the	difference	between the person who knock you down to take you purse and the person who knock he down to come to you rescue . burrow believe that smack be as necessary as kisse and cuddl , and find it ironic that the same kind of argument about parent not know when to stop be use to underi we instinct in both case . she say : smack be a way of educat the aggressive instinct of child .
they know the limit . burrow also believe that smack can be start at an early age . she disagree with leach 's statement that two - year - old cannot be good or naughty on purpose because they do not yet know right from wrong or understand what make the	difference	. burrow say : you can have a one - year - old on you lap who discover it be possible to stick a pencil up you nose . one child will respond to the idea of not hurte mummy .
have survive a financial crisis in the early 1980 , thank to support from the bank and from a staff prepare to agree to a voluntary wage freeze , the paper be now make money and put on reader , so why have the management now decide to modernise the title on first sight it might seem a case of plus can change , plus c'est la meme choose . the	difference	be minimal : clean print , a slight small format somewhere between tabloid and broadsheet , the masthead underline in blue and , the much strik development : the appearance of separate section . but , as the editor andre fontaine explain : it be not so much a new layout as a new presentation . newspaper reader be very conservative the chang be not suppose to shock .
the task will undoubtable fall heaviest on andre fontaine , who with the death earlier this summer of the newspaper 's founder hubert beuve - mery , have to shoulder the burden alone . i look around , he say , and there be no one there behind . the	difference	he and he production team have introduce may be one of detail , but be no less revolutionary for that . whatever the reader 's perception , le monde be change and will go on do so for some time to come . media : women 's monthly magazine : circulation figure
perhaps it be not possible to produce peter shaffer 's 1964 play about the conquest of peru in a way that be inform by we subsequently increase awareness of how such representation works . but in wonder it be intereste to compare a much much recent success , david henry hwang 's m butterf . hwang 's devotion to theatrical effect suggest that he share shaffer 's belief that peacockery be one of the dramatist 's obligation , and both play concern an effort at a human relationship across cultural	difference	: pizarro 's fascination with the defeate inca god - k atahuallpa , and gallimard 's desire for he butterfly . but whereas in m butterf the theatrical flash and illusion be entirele implicate in the theme of the representation and misrecognition of one culture by another , in the royal hunt of the sun , at little in this revival , it have no such purpose . if anything , tim pigott - smith 's tour compass production accentuate the way that the inca be conceive in european term .
the party 's new policy be that sworke take sympathy action would have to demonstrate a genuine interest in any dispute . a labour government would have to define what that mean . norman fowler , secretary of state for employment , be likely to exploit the	difference	already emerge yesterday between right and leave - w union leader over how far the definition should go . jimmy knapp , leave - w leader of the national union of railwaymen believe that he member have a genuine interest in the miner 's strike because pit closure would mean few coal train . bill jordan , right - w leader of the amalgamated engineer union , however argue yesterday that secondary action should be limit to direct supplier and direct customer .
the trip be a good experience . have watch television documentary about life in east germany , becker be keen to see for he for the first time . what shock i be that one wall could make such a	difference	, he say . it be hard to believe the change you could see by move just a couple of kilometre out of west germany , one of the richest country in the world . as a far 11 , 000 refugee be arrive yesterday in the hope of share this prosperity before the back door from czechoslovakia be close again , becker add : i be not surprise that they want to come .
he decline to give any official view on the situation except to say : any marxist must say it be a good thing that nobody have be hurt and we should give thanks to the police . jan urban , a former spokesman for the charter 77 right group and co - ordinator of a joint east european information service , be among numerous czechoslovak who befriend the refugee . he say the debacle have be very important in czechoslovakia : it have show that people can make a	difference	. live in a totalitarian system , he say , you be teach all the time that it be unbreakable . it have no weaknesses , it be impossible to fight .
art market : historical footnote put value on clock by geraldine norman what apparently make all the	difference	to the price be that the clock come from a historic house , cassiobury park , and that it be illustrate in an important book on the craftsman thoma tompion , his life and work by r w symonds . collector love to be able to show friend the book with they own clock illustrate in it . a monthgoing longcase clock of about 1710 by daniel delander also profit from a good footnote , sell for 104,500 ( estimate 45 , 000 - 55 , 000 ) although the case which be originally ebonise be now paint blue .
there be a social stigma attach to diesel car ownership , too . people think perhaps you need to save money after all , that be the only reason for buy a diesel car , be not it what few realise be that diesel be very costly than they petrol - engine counterpart , and that the break - even point ( when the fuel saving outweigh the price	difference	) do not occur until very large mileage have be cover . that who sell they diesel after 50 , 000 mile or so might just as well have buy a petrol vehicle . at little that be the case in britain , where the gap between petrol and diesel fuel price have always be small .
top speed for this diesel be 96mph , and it spurt to 60mph in just 13.2 second . much un - diesel - like . on the road , the big	difference	you notice with the diesel be the need to change up a gear slight early than in a petrol car . this be not a hardship , as the ax be bless with one of the lightest and quicke gear change around . the diesel never feel sloven and can be hurry along snake back road with the sort of haste which soon make you forget that derv , not four - star ( or unleade ) , go into it fuel tank .
go for the clod , spoot the rocks . lurch along in this enclosed space , one lose all sense of direction . the field be on a slope , so that there be a	difference	between go up and go down but that be all . this potato be round and white , a new dutch strain , be grow in britain for the first time this year . they have be bre specially for chipp : they be not good for boile because they tend to explode , but they cake fast and hideous think absorb fat quickly .
generation of lobby journalist at westminster have have to tussle with the challenge of reconcil the remark tory politician be prepare to make off the record with the ring declarations of total loyalty and conformity they deliver in public . ( the labour party , to be fair , have never observe quite the same double standard when it come to private and public speech ) . the	difference	, and the difficulty , for the television reporter be that he inevitable become a partner in this process of suppression . any television documentary be entirele dependent on what it participant be prepare to say on camerum the winks and nudge of write journalism can have very little place in it . in that sense , if in no other , i have feel this past week rather like a dentist .
after a boom , inflation have go up and there have be a disastrous show on the balance of payment . maudl , barber and now lawson the consistency of the disastrous outcome be hard to equal . the only	difference	be that in the 1950 and the 1980 the conservative have much than 10 year to cure the ills of the economy while in the 1970 they have but four . the structural problem of the economy remain inadequate save , uncompetitive industry and insufficient investment in human capital . after all the boast of supply - side miracle under one slogan or another from 1951 to 1989 , the british economy remain sick .
by john pienaar if this week have strike display of labour unity be very show than substance , there be no sign of it among the party 's other rank as they disperse in buoyant mood from brighton . all around the conference centre , the message be the same from all but the large isolated activist of the hard - leave :	difference	on the detail of neil kinnock 's policy review take second place to it status as labour 's only route - map to political power . dread of failure , as much as positive enthusiasm for labour 's change of direction , be a drive motivation for offer the much appeale face possible at the next election . constituency labour party and trade union delegate seize eager on the common feeling that the conservative economic and political trial , and the disarray of the centre party , be at last combin to open a window of opportunity .
write a letter state you objection or support for the application and send a copy to every member as well as the chief plan officer . contact you ward councillor and try to inter he or she even if they be not on the committee they may be able to influence the councillor who will take the decision . they may also be able to tell you some of the preference of that councillor , which can make a big	difference	to how you lobby they . the actual meet will be open to the public . sometimes a limit number of people will be allow to address the councillor for or against a proposal at the meet .
brook 's concern be compound when dick fairbank , a halifax forward dismiss in the same match for a transgression descri by he president as mere retaliatory fisticuff , receive a five - match ban . either fairbank 's punishment be disproportionate , or whitehead get off light , brook say . the league appear to be say that the	difference	between scrapp and cynical wounding be just three matches . the other club to fall foul of the disciplinary committee yesterday be st helens , who travel to wakefield tomorrow without roy haggerty and stuart evan , both ban for four matches . they be dismiss against oldham last week , evan in the final minute of a 36 - 6 defeat , after miss the start of the season through injury .
cloud rise in thin column up the mountain side , grey upon grey , and start smudge out the valley . the hilltop we be aim for look like an angry volcano . i ask m higgin what the	difference	be between the monsoon and the pre - monsoon . oh , bout two week , she say from behind she ray - ban sunglasses . we climb into the cloud and a coole drizzle begin to fall .
a similar comparison be make by the minister ( michael howard mp ) when defend the poll tax in the house on 18 april 1988 . it be entirele fallacious . there be two fundamental	difference	between the two . first , the licence fee be voluntary : nobody be force to buy the bbc 's product . payment of the community charge be compulsory , which be why it be very accurate characterise as a tax than a charge .
the angolan government , increase look to free market policy to revive the economy , last month join the international monetary fund in washington , and say , as it have for the past three year , that a devaluation of the kwanza and the lift of control on many good be imminent . market like rock santeiro do it long ago . the huge	difference	between the official and parallel market price make a nightmare out of the month shopp budget . a mode pile of six or seven tomato cost about 10 or ten pence depend on you calculation , while a pound of meat easy wipe out a month 's salary . but salary be large irrelevant in angola , because there be so much money and so few thing to buy .
the swede ' 3 - 1 victory over albania yesterday leave robson mildly disappoint but england still have control of group two , he say . i be hope the swede would draw and drop a point , but we be still in a strong position . like we , they have eight point with one game to play , but we goal	difference	be plus 10 to they four . they final match be also in poland . the loss of steve hodge with hamstr trouble 24 hour after the withdrawal of john barne , have left england short of cover on the flank , but robson again decide against summon a replacement .
mr morton descri weekend press report of a serious rift between eurotunnel and transmanche link , the consortium of british and french construction firm build the tunnel , as the batman school of journalism . there be no row or brawl go on , he add . what there be be a strong	difference	of commercial opinion . however , it be clear the two side be far from agreement on the extra 382m tml claim the tunnel terminal and fix equipment will cose , which mr morton descri as manifestly absurd . he refuse to be draw on what would happen if the two fail to reach agreement in time to get the bank 's support for an extra 1bn - 1.2bn of finance next year .
the public debate about political priority focus far too much on what we can do for today 's consumption and far too little about what we invest in the future . research and development should be take a big priority in we public expenditure and within the private sector than it be even now . but there be other	difference	between the government frontbench and the man in the wing . on poll tax , he say with due modesty : there be nothing attractive in politics about the language of i tell you so . ' he tell the conservative party that it would be an unpopular tax when he first oppose the idea successfully as secretary of state for the environment in the early eighty .
at which point i ask mr heseltine what he be up to . what be he game he support the government , he be loyal , but there too often appeare shade of	difference	which set he apart as a challenger . he say that cabinet and party be coalition ; group of people with a common philosophy , provide a start point in many discussion which enable they to work they way by dialogue through to agreement . inside cabinet , he have play that role , with the required public discretion , to argue the case for council house sale , industrial competition , and the inner city policy .
one must recognise that this poll take place , but also careful remember that a decision about any vacancy that take place be take by i colleague in the house of commons , and not the general public . mr heseltine also defend nigel lawson 's decision to put inter rate up to 15 per cent , and hope the chancellor would be give a courteous reception when he address conference on thursday . but in he interview with the independent , mr heseltine stak out the area of	difference	between he and he front - bench colleague . on the nhs change , he say he would support the legislation because it be design to make the service very effective and efficient . but he then side with many professional and political critics of the government 's plan , say : have get the legislation , it would be wise to proceed by demonstration of success rather than try a root - and - branch revolutionary approach .
he will find it less easy to defend he involvement with a cricket call - line service last summer , a job that some will say keep he from he yorkshire priority . there will be criticism that team discipline off the field be want , a complaint that have surface with reasonable regularity since before lord hawke 's time . the	difference	be , it will be quickly point out , be that hawke 's team be winner . there have be some fair loose and wide - range snip about ineep leadership ( carrick ) and incompetence ( the committee ) . everyone agree that something will have to be see to be do before the next annual general meet in february .
we parent in america seem to be cow a lot . but the order come down from above and we jump to it . private school or public , it make no	difference	. fund must be raise and we be command to raise they . this week 's newsletter advise that a contribution of 40 per family will bring the pta fund up to satisfactory level .
with nine point , they would be certain to qualify even if they be overtake by sweden . if england lose they can still reach the final as one of the good two second - plac team in the three four - team european group . in such circumstance england 's goal	difference	could give they an advantage over , say , denmark in group one or the netherland in group four , both of who complete they fixture next month . _ : rival speechless on the eve of battle from joe lovejoy in dublin
we have the land and the right planning framework to create new community that do offer the sort of house and live condition that many people be look for . many major housebuilder be already here , and large development opportunity of the size of foxley wood be be offer . the	difference	be that they take place within an agreed plan and programme . what be amazing , therefore , be that the agency that have the responsibility for this programme milton keyne development corporation have be large wind down over the past few year and the remainder of it will cease to exist in 1992 . along with many of the other development corporation , the skills and experience in create new community have be disperse a fact that always amaze foreign visitor who look on british new town as one of the major achievement of post - war plan anywhere in the world .
a sociology graduate , whether from a university or polytechnic , be 10 time very likely to be unemploy or in short - term employment than a building , pharmacy or civil engineer graduate . there be no subject where attend a polytechnic increase the statistical likelihood of be unemploy by much than three or four time . choice of a particular university or polytechnic make even less	difference	. if you take the crude figure , the difference between university look dramatic . over the three year , 1986 - 8 , 7.3 per cent of aston 's graduate be unemploy or in temporary employment six month after graduation ; at sussex , 13.5 per cent .
unemployment be high than expect by 3 per cent or very at ulster ( 5.5 ) , liverpool and queen mary college , london ( both 4.8 ) , east anglia ( 3.4 ) and sheffield , aberystwyth and the london school of economics ( all 3.2 ) . other university where unemployment be high than expect included stirling ( 2.8 ) and university college london ( 2.5 ) . education : how politick have splight the vice - chancellor : the student 's fe campaign have expose	difference	between university leader , ngaio crequer say by ngaio crequer vice - chancellors be not normally know for they speed of action and this be how it should be : university be reflective , discursive community .
by steve bale it be small consolation to cardiff that they will be spar the full force of the all blacks on saturday . yesterday 's initial tour selection be so strong as to make no	difference	. there be 10 of the player who beat australia in august , all but mike brewer have start each of new zealand 's five summer test . indeed alex wyllie , they coach , already expect to reselect he t team an bloc : there will not be change as long as that player keep they form .
he do not look particularly inspire at the start of the day , but survive to make the semi - final where he meet he old rival , ben spijker , of the netherland . it be very much a revenge match for white spijker have beat he for a bronze in the seoul olympics , though then white be injure . now white be fit but it make no	difference	. in the intense , cagey and close match that follow , white put in much attack , but perhaps spijker 's attack be very effective . chris bowles , the british coach , be circumspect .
by jeremy warner stock brok analyst be about to start make choice about which of the 10 water authority be float in early december be worth invest in . to ensure the successful flotation of all 10 , the government have attempt to gloss over	difference	and have reconstruct the authority financial to make they seem equally attractive . stock brok firms that be involve in the issue or act for the authority have be ban in the run up to flotation from issue any research . there appear to be only three front rank firms not involve and therefore not cover by the ban cl - alexander lae cruickshank , citicorp scrimgeour vicker and hoare govett .
if rate fall below the exit rate , the customer pay the market rate plus the difference between the contract and exit rate . thus , if the contract rate be 14 per cent , the exit rate might be 13.65 per cent . should inter rate fall to 9 per cent , the customer would pay 9 per cent , plus 0.35 per cent , the	difference	between the contract and exit rate . the third element be the duration of the hedge . an agreement would normally embrace a number of intere rate renewal period of three , six , nine or 12 month over a total of two year .
world view : so close yet still far apart : timothy garton ash reflect on what it mean when german start behave like pole , and pole like german by timothy garton ash what be the	difference	between pole and german the german can make any system work . the pole can destroy any system .
a fifth mistaken approach be the facile assertion that opponent be be inconsistent . there be two line of rebuttal . one be to say that there be subtle	difference	which explain alleged inconsistency , as for example between bann experiment altogether or after 14 day yet allow late abortion . some people believe that the different intention of the experimenter and the abortionist , or the different location of the embryo in a petri dish or in a woman 's womb , be morally relevant factor . it behove the sceptics among we to listen and argue rather than to whoop with delight at the superficial difficulty .
or it use to be so . one of the many adverse criticism of albert ferrasse and jacques fouroux be that , for involve reason of french rugby politics , they have ostracise the toulouse club together with such player as denis charvet and eric bonneval , who would walk on merit into any northern hemisphere xv . again , the lion combination which win the series against australia be despite	difference	in the forward 's technique essentially england and scotland plus robert jone . he , however , be become increasingly petulant and argumentative , play scrum - half like a thwarted 15 - year - old on the netball court . in a pique against harlequin last saturday he fling the ball at the opposition tighthead prop and be lucky not to be send off .
by bill colwill it be eappropriat that , for the first stage of the heineken trophy , hockey 's answer to football 's charity shield , the country 's two foremost club should meet : hounslow , the hockey association cup - winner , and southgate , the national league champion , write bill colwill . southgate , who take the league title on goal	difference	from havant , will be out to avenge they penalty - streak defeat by hounslow in the league cup final at luton last april , after the team have draw 2 - 2 at the end of normal time . under sean kerly , southgate have get they act together quickly , even allow for the loss of such player as richard dodds and robert clift , peter boxell and jagdis barber , and through injury , rupert welch and john shaw . hounslow have be very fortunate .
if anything , the big citroen 's styling lean very towards the quirky camp there will be no mistak it for anything else on the road , love it or hate it . as unusual as it styl be the xm 's suspension system . instead of mere react to	difference	in the road surface , as a conventional suspension system do , it anticipate bump and bend . it do this through sensor which monitor speed and body movement , and this information be pass on to a computer . for normal drive condition the computer choose a soft suspension setting , but at speed and during sharp handling and emergency manoeuvre , it switch automatically to a firmer setting .
the second weakness in the government 's position be that in an important respect it be ambiguous . the prime minister oppose entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system ; the chancellor favour it . instead of adopt one or other of this policy , they have try to hide they	difference	beneath an uneasy and evasive compromise . neither mrs thatch nor mr lawson be able to mention the subject from the platform . this be bad politics as well as bad economics .
altogether 70 by - election have be hold since 7 september . the conservative won 20 ( gain 6 , lose 9 ) ; labou win 29 ( gain 10 , lose 4 ) ; the sld won 17 ( gain 6 , lose 5 ) ; the sdp lose both seat it previously hold ; independents won 4 ( gain 3 , lose 5 ) . there be nothing new about the centre do well in by - election than poll , but the	difference	be now particularly mark . one indicator of the sld 's campaign streng lie in it performance compare with that of the greens . candidate from the two party fight each other in 11 seat .
the main reason for a lot be that they be in trouble because of high mortgage rate . the company then enter detail of you property , and what sort of exchange - price , location and so on you be look for , in it computer database . the advantage of an exchange rather than a sale , say mr nunn ( who set up the business after he successfully swap he own home ) , be : no chain of buyer and seller to fall through , stamp duty be payable only on any	difference	in price between the two property , and agent 's fe be little . around two third of mr nunn 's exchanger be look for a nearby property . detail on 0273 608311 .
on the rental side , a three - bedroom flat in such an area will cose around 25 , 000 franc ( 2,500 ) a month . for cheaper up - and - come area , she advise buyer to look around the bastille and le valois perret , where price work out at 20 - 40 a square metre about 100 , 000 for a typical two - bedroom flat . if you be go to buy in france , remember that cultural	difference	can have a big impact . the french seem very nervous about buy garden flat , for example , than the british , so this can often be proportionately cheaper . flat at the top of old building without lift be also less expensive for that healthy enough to cope with walk up six floor .
the market be so bad now that it will not get any worse , at little in the south , say richard robert , an economist with barclay bank . it will go on be like it be for long . many estate agents be whistle to keep up they confidence this week , claim that people be already use to the idea of high mortgage rate and that the late increase would make little	difference	. but gary marsh , head of research with the halifax , the uk 's big building society , say it be inevitable that the mode improvement see in the market over the last couple of month especially in the south , where seller have start to adjust to very realistic level will be damage and the date of it recovery put back . i think we be go to see that slight pick - up disappear .
in the last three year , for example , property price have rise by 68.5 per cent , while the ft all share index have rise by only 52.1 per cent . add in the tax payable on share gain , and the comparison look even bad . before you cheer up too much , though , there be an important	difference	. it be much very difficult to get at property profit than at share profit everyone have to live somewhere . it be also a lot easy to shop around among different share .
the south korean be rat because they make it to the last world cup final , but personal i will always think of the north korean in 66 . remember ayresome park and that centre forward , what be he name , pak doo ik knee - high to a gnat but it make no	difference	. could not stop he . the north korean whup the italians , and actual cause a debate on football in the italian parliament .
reserve police in the ruc wear the same uniform , for all that an outsider can distinguish , and as a consequence face the same security risk , but much be marginalize by the restrict range of duty they perform and the short - term status of they contract . part - time male reservist do only sang ( guard ) duty , either at the station or at other location ; female reservist be restrict in the main to the guard room inside the station , with only full - time reserve policeman carry the responsibility for a broad range of task , although few be involve in the paperwork for a case file . but the task of reserve police vary across sections and stations , and in some rural area there be no	difference	in they responsibility compare to regular policeman , knowledge of which make part - time reserve police in easton very sensitive to they lowly position within the police bureaucracy . full - time reserve police on the whole be people who be disqualify from enter the regular force as a result of age , height , or physical health . a few be try out police by join the reserf first , although the common view amongst the reserve police be that it be harder for they to transfer to the regular than it be for someone without experience to sign up straight away because of the great number of reason the police authority be thereby give for turn they down .
the few female there be in senior management seem to endorse this . a senior female officer explain to an assemb of policewoman who be be train in how to operate a casualty bureau that they be good suit to operat the telephone because of they good manner and compassionate nature ( fn 29/5/87 , p . 2 ) . in talk to ordinary policewoman , we find many they adopt notion of gender	difference	in order to explain the marginalization of they duty , although other prefer this kind of work simply because it make it easy to manage they difficult and conflict role as policewoman , wife , and mother . that be , stransfe be fewer for that in administrative post and in specialist sex abuse unit , and the hour of work be less disruptive to home life . yet other rebel against this marginalization and demand both the right to perform the full range of police work ( from which follow the wish to carry gun ) and that man should become very involve in deal with child and female offence .
they include the financial owner , manager , lender , customer and community in which the organisation operate . 4 application of markete idea in an international context as companies go international they need to pose the question be there	difference	between domestic and international market although significant difference exist , the basic similarity should be remember . the essential concept and process of markete apply as much to market in the international arena as the domestic one .
4 application of markete idea in an international context as companies go international they need to pose the question be there difference between domestic and international market although significant	difference	exist , the basic similarity should be remember . the essential concept and process of markete apply as much to market in the international arena as the domestic one . so , when a company first look to expand abroad , the same process need to be adopt .
so , when a company first look to expand abroad , the same process need to be adopt . too many company enter foreign market without analys sufficiently either the customer or the competition in that market . international market differ from it domestic counterpart due purely to the	difference	in the political , social , cultural and economic environment between country . much of this text be devote to consider the nature of that difference and how the international market manage can overcome they . how much they need to be overcome to implement a successful international market policy be a matter of considerable debate among market expert and section 5 of this chapter review the idea of the two main school of think .
levitt simply assert the opposite that low - cost operations be the stamp of corporate culture pervade by the etho of quality . they be , he say , compatible , twin identity of superior practice . there be another way of view levitt 's argument ; the relative importance of between - country and within - country	difference	to the market manage . by implication , levitt take the view that a global market should be view as one with particular market segment that may bear little or no relationship to geographical boundary . in other word , variation in market homogeneity be very mark within country than between they .
levitt consider many japanese companies as the first truly global marketer and contrast they practice strongly with the approach take by hoover in market automatic wash machine in europe . in the 1960 , hoover be look to increase the output of it manufactur plant closer to it capacity level and so intended to boose it sale in mainland europe . market research show considerable	difference	in consum preference in various country . this be summarise below . hoover conclude that consum preference must be meet by provide model for national market that incorporate the specific feature market research have bring to light .
however , whilst this method of comparison rely on easily available information , it be not exact ; exchange rate relate to good which be trade internationally , whilst the the majority of the national product of many country be comprise of good which never enter the international marketplace . the difference in real income can thus be distort . as just one example , agricultural good be generally pric low in relation to industrial product in develope country than in industrial country , and this may lead to an exaggeration of the apparent	difference	in per capita income . another potentially distor factor be that whilst average income can be compare between one country and another , they do not of they reveal the true comparable standard of living , nor the comparable potential market for all product . develope country , for example , consume many of the same good as industrialised country , but may have little or no expenditure on heating , public utility , medicine , etc .
some nation be predominantly tea drinker , other will generally prefer coffee . culture influence almost every aspect of the reaction to a particular product texture , colour , desire for innovation or respect for tradition and so on . although some cultural	difference	, such as mean attribute to basic pattern of syntax in otherwise similar communication pattern be difficult to spoot , a long list can be compil of easy identify cultural seperation . very difficult to identify be the basic factor which be common to all human being , but it be in this that the international marketer will be much interested , since they provide a basis upon which to market good in a way which should have broad appeal . some cultural universal can be observe from the work of a h maslow , who hypothesise a hierarchy of need , whereby the satisfaction of a low need will result in it be replace by a high need .
late majority the follow 34 % ; laggard the final 16 % . a far strike	difference	between country which be part cultural in origin can be find in the differ legal rule which apply to business relationship . individual from different culture may not only contract together use different cultural assumption , but use an entire different legal framework . south korean culture
this story draw attention to two point . ( a ) there be a	difference	between existe and potential market . a potential market might exist when there be not yet any such market in existence . ( b )
it assume that the country 's market be analogous . ( c ) it ignore the	difference	between actual demand and potential demand . even if it can estimate potential market demand in a country , actual demand will not materialise unless a similar situation apply to product availability , price , quality etc in both country . income elasticity measurement
y = a + b x where y = demand for a product , typically express as the number of household per 1 , 000 of the population that own one of the product ( a car , television , video recorder etc ) . x = an independent variable , typically gdp per head or gnp per head of the population . demand for the product next year would be calculate from the formula by take the	difference	between project total number own next year and total number own currently . the reliability of the statistical estimate can be measure by a coefficient of determination , r . for example , the ownership of car per 1 , 000 of the population might be estimate from historical data as follow .
an international company be like to rely on agents to sell it product to the country 's market . univariate and bivariate analysis statistical technique can be use to compare survey data ( primary data ) collect in one country with survey data from another country , in order to test for similarity or	difference	between the country . some of the simpl technique be mention here . cross tabulation .
for example , a survey of 1 , 800 work woman in france might show that 38 % read at little one magazine week , and a similar survey in west germany of 940 work woman show that 47 % of they read at little one magazine week . a t - test would show whether german worke woman appear to be significantly great reader of magazine than they french counterpart . any significant	difference	could have implication for the selection of advertise media/overall market mix in each country . cluster analysis . cluster analysis be use to group variable , object or individual into group or cluster of variable , object or individual that have certain similarity with each other .
you turn to keep watch ! at first light the mortaring and snip start . the only	difference	be that the mortar burst be far away than yesterday , some be even land in the village . the snip be still fairly accurate and still concentrat in and around the orchard . someone bring i a mess tin half full of very hot tea ; it tast good .
at little the new brigadier serve in the irish guard and they have piper . i would just have to wait and see . the capture of the village yesterday evening do not make much	difference	to we situation in and around the village . the enemy , it appear , have withdraw a short distance from the area in front of 6 commando , the front be just the same in front of the other commando unit . another mortar team have move into the orchard this evening , 13th june , and get down to work straight away by send off several round of high explosive in quick succession in the direction of the enemy position .
the front door be open , as we approach , a light come on , probably from an oil lamp . i could now smell the very strong aroma of fry onion as we enter the cottage . the scene before i remind i of the very similar scene in the highland croft , the only	difference	be the now almost overpower smell of onion . in the dim light of the oil lamp hang from a chain attach to a very black beam above the fireplace , and the glow from the log fire . i could see that the room be very sparsely furnish .
it be difficult to compare the perception of labour and conservative identifier who read the same paper since the number in we sample who read any one paper be low and tended to be draw predominantly from one party or another . a breakdown be possible only for large - circulation paper like the sun and the mirror . amongst mirror reader , there be no	difference	between labour and conservative identifier in they perception of the mirror 's anti - conservative bias , though conservative mirror reader be somewhat less likely to detect a pro - labour bias . amongst sun reader , there be little difference between labour and conservative identifier in they perception of it anti - labour , pro - conservative bias . both labour and conservative sun reader increase allege pro - conservative bias in the sun as the campaign draw to a close .
this chapter use two technique to investigate media influence . to assess the impact of pervasive and consensual television news we can correlate trend in television news content and trend in overall public perception . to assess the impact of very differentiate media source we can look for	difference	between reader of highbrow or lowbrow paper , for example , or between reader of right - w and leave - w paper . the impact of a changing television consensus our analysis of television news content in chapter 4 show that controversy reach a peak on television in the third week of the campaign .
but this effect have decline to only 22 per cent by the last fortnight of the campaign . similarly , reader of lowbrow paper be relative ill - inform about poll before the campaign but catch up on highbrow reader late : the effect of read a highbrow paper decline from 33 per cent in the pre - campaign wave to only 15 per cent in the close stage of the campaign . by contrast , the	difference	between that who do and do not watch bbc - tv widen : so the effect of television view rose from 12 per cent in the pre - campaign wave to 20 per cent in the last fortnight of the campaign . thus , as the election approach , the basis of public awareness of opinion poll shift from very personal factor like political interest or choice of paper , to very impersonal mobilize factor like television news . the kind of people who be much aware of public opinion poll in the close stage of the campaign be very different from the kind of people who be much aware of they in the mid - term ( table 7.6 ) .
we have already not the correlation between overall trend in perception of opinion poll and trend in perception of party prospect ( see table 7.3 ) . at any one time there be wide difference of opinion about party chance however . some of that	difference	be relative unpredictable . it be always fair difficult to predict difference of opinion about conservative and alliance chance . in the precampaign week , conservative voter be very optimistic about conservative chanc , labour voter about labour chanc , and alliance voter about alliance chanc ; but the partisan influence on perception of conservative and alliance chanc be much small than on perception of labour chanc .
a trend analyse confirm this regression finding . there be always an enormous difference between the economic perception of that who initially have conservative and labour preference , especially tho who descri they as party supporter . the	difference	be large when they focus be on britain ( not they ) last year ( not next year ) . irrespective of the focus , however , the difference widen as the election approach . because a majority of conservative supporter be economic optimist and a majority of labour supporter be economic pessimist , the difference between net optimism amongst conservative and labour supporter exceed 100 per cent : it be 105 per cent in the pre - campaign wave , rise to 121 per cent by the end of the campaign .

irrespective of the focus , however , the difference widen as the election approach . because a majority of conservative supporter be economic optimist and a majority of labour supporter be economic pessimist , the difference between net optimism amongst conservative and labour supporter exceed 100 per cent : it be 105 per cent in the pre - campaign wave , rise to 121 per cent by the end of the campaign . amongst party identifier as a whole , the	difference	between conservative and labour optimism rise from 93 per cent in the pre - campaign wave to 108 per cent by the end of the campaign . compare to this enormous influence of personal prejudice the influence of the medium on economic perception be small but none the less significant . amongst labour partisan in particular the influence of the medium very than double towards the end of the campaign , as labour reader of right - w paper switch from pessimism to optimism .
public awareness of opinion poll be much predictable in the pre - campaign wave and become steadily less predictable as the election approach and awareness spread throughout the electorate . before the campaign opened the key influence on poll awareness be a generalize interest in politics , but as the campaign draw to an end television view become very important . before the campaign there be a 41 per cent	difference	in awareness of poll between that with high and low level of interest in politics ; but this decline to 22 per cent by the end of the campaign . reader of lowbrow paper be relative ill inform about poll before the campaign but catch up with highbrow reader late . conversely the difference between that who do and do not watch television widen .
before the campaign there be a 41 per cent difference in awareness of poll between that with high and low level of interest in politics ; but this decline to 22 per cent by the end of the campaign . reader of lowbrow paper be relative ill inform about poll before the campaign but catch up with highbrow reader late . conversely the	difference	between that who do and do not watch television widen . as the election approach , the basis of awareness shift from very personal resource like political interest or choice of paper , to very impersonal mobilize factor like television news . the kind of people who be aware of public opinion poll in the close stage of the campaign be very different from the kind of people who follow they in the mid - term .
but that be only part of the explanation for the magnitude of they sw to the conservative . the fact that uncommitted voter who read the sun or star swing so much much than other uncommitted voter suggest that this paper be particularly good at influence they reader . swings be high amongst voter who watch both bbc and itv news , and amongst that who avoid watch highbrow television news programme , but the	difference	between this group of television viewer be slight . once we distinguish between party supporter and uncommitted voter we find no consistent difference between voter with different view habit . swing be high amongst that who rely very on television than the press for help in decide how to vote , rather low amongst that who rely very on the press , and low of all amongst the 40 per cent of the electorate who find television and the press equally useful .

( see chapter 6 on who find the press and television much useful . )
on issue like unilateralism or the economy , paper like the guardian and telegraph do seem to influence they reader as much as the tabloid , but not on the question of vot choice . persistent guardian reader swing strongly towards a much unilateralist position , while telegraph and time reader swing in the opposite direction . the	difference	between mirror and sun/star reader be in the expect direction but quite small . similarly , on swing toward optimism about the state of the economy , the difference between guardian and telegraph/times reader be great than between mirror and sun/star reader . once again , however , difference between voter with different viewing habit be slight ( table 8.18 ) .
that may be true , but in 1987 hostile interview with neil kinnock try to explain he party 's defence policy count as part of the labour party 's coverage . coverage of all kind can be both favourable and unfavourable no matter whether politician be in government or in opposition and politician they must bear the prime responsibility for ensure that when they do get access to the medium they present they own case well . there be no	difference	between government coverage and party coverage in this respect except that government have much initiative in determi the news , which mean that it have much opportunity than the opposition to ensure that it coverage be favourable . so long as balance be define in terms of the quantity of party coverage and not whether it be favourable or unfavourable then the only justification for award the government extra coverage be that the government represent order , stability , and legitimate authority , which the medium have a duty to support . that who do not apprive the mobilizing ideal for the medium should not apprive extra medium time for the government , especially near to election time .
right - w reader of a right - w paper be very likely than leave - w reader of that same paper to claim that they paper be biase towards the right though a majority of both leave - and right - w reader typically agree that they paper be biase and agree on the direction of that bias . instead of react against the bias in they chose paper , reader tend ( at the margin ) to defend they paper ( if it be biase against they party ) or even to glory in it bias ( if it be biase in favour of they party ) . the	difference	between public response to perception of bias in the press and on television be reflecte in the complex relationship between voter 's allegation of bias and they rating of the usefulness of the press and television news . sviewe who allege bias on television tend to give television news low mark for usefulness than viewer who perceive no bias on television ; but reader who allege bias in they paper tend to give they paper high mark for usefulness than reader who perceive no bias in they paper ( chapter 6 ) . overall , although reader be well aware that they paper be relative bias compare to television and although they rate television as much very useful for provide information about issue , they do not rate television much very useful in help they decide how to vote .
the switch of new focus clearly have some influence on the public 's agenda but a remarkable small one : in terms of television influence the public 's agenda the cause seem much great than the effect . once in four year : the findings a major theme that run through we finding be the enormous	difference	between election and non - election time . in the midterm between election inter in politics be much high amongst high educated voter and amongst regular reader of the quality press the guardian , the telegraph , the time , and similar paper . but that be no long true at election time : as the election approach the high educated became less interested and the less well educat become very interested ( chapter 2 ) .
when the constituent assembly be dissolve after the 1917 revolution , and the bolsheviks 's land decree have stol the main plank of the socialist revolutionaries 's platform , siberian and black - earth peasant alike fail to give any further support to they still loyal party , despite the fact that for a period an sr - dominate directory prevail in eastern russia . the vote for the sr have be strong in the kursk and poltava gubernii . far non - economic influence that cannot be ignore be ethnic and religious	difference	. this do not concern we for kursk guberniium , which be almost exclusive great russian and orthodox , but the traditional independence of the old believer element in the siberian peasantry must not be forget . kursk differ radical in this way from poltava , which lie in the ukraine .
a local priest be even so bold as to call the system a home - brew democracy . in the town they drink wine and liqueur , but we can not do that in the village the result be that the gent can drink , but it be forbide to the low classes . another	difference	between nikol 's skaium and roslavl 's be the obvious great isolation of the former , although it be near to the guberniium capital . that do not mean much , since kursk be it a drowsy centre with almost no factory and only the main railway line from moscow to enlive it . as late as 1926 90.9 per cent of all inhabitant in the guberniium be in rural location , one of the high percentage for european russia .
the reality of aid be that the person can die at any time . the person be need to know when and how be sometimes overwhelm . one of the	difficultie	be that every person 's situation be different . the medical aspect can be dementium , sudden blindness , loss of mobility , thrush , shingle , kaposi 's sarcoma ( a type of cancer ) , weight loss , or any combination of this . the person 's circumstance may change rapid , from own occupier to homelessness ; from a good income to live on sickness benefit ; from young and active to housebound and disable .
you cannot simply draw up a covenant ( or a deposite covenant agreement ) to cover a donation you have already make in the hope that acet can obtain tax advantage on the sum give . however , it can be possible for the documents to be sign after you have send a payment by cheque provide that you arrange for we to hold the cheque and not pay it into the bank until we have receive the signed deed of covenant . what happen if i have	difficulty	in continue to make payment if this unlikely situation arise , you should discuss the problem with we . although acet , like any charity , do not have the power to release you from the agreement it be likely to be sympathetic .
emotional support the common cause of death now be advance kaposi 's sarcoma a painful cancer . slowly grow lesion can produce	difficultie	in the lung and the gut , cause many problem include shortness of breath , and period of continuous pain . acet scotland : who will care for i children when i die it be hard to fatho the pain feel at the death of a son or daughter , husband or wife , partner or friend .
begin at the begin , the king say grave , and go on till you come to the end : then stop . many art book follow this plan , especially tho aim to take in a national culture or a whole civilisation . art history often make an attempt to keep to chronology , although the	difficultie	include the crucial fact that in art there be no clear sequence of event . unlike old - fashion narrative history , art have no decisive battle , no international treaty , and no change of government . this be perhaps a very useful analogy than might at first sight appear .
the face , however , show a realism and subtlety of characterization that be coysevox 's own . he be the first of a long line of distinguish french portrait sculptor . without comparative material , the reader be in serious	difficulty	about know whether to agree with this three - way discriminative judgement . gombrich be scholarly work include many paper on meaning and interpretation in the visual art , so that the broad but thin scope of he story of art be instructive ; by write a survey he inevitable limit he to a narrow range of comment . he book stress the history of style , which he describe in sequence , baroque for example be follow by rococo , and neo - classicism .
again , much intere attach to interpretation , as an impassive hierarchical image of the madonna be soften through the century into a much human and tender figure . the multitude of madonna for italian worship in the renaissance make this a fruitful theme for connoisseurship which have take on the task of distinguish authentic works from that by follower or copyist . an art critic may have	difficulty	in decide how far the picture need to be consider as devotional imagery , and how far discussion can be limit to artistic merit . an extremist view express by a twenty - century artist be what matisse have to say about he response to mural by giotto . when i see the giotto fresco at padua i do not trouble to recognise which scene in the life of christ i have before i , but i perceive instantly the sentiment which radiate from it and which be instinct in the composition in every line and color .
sculptural monographs book about sculpture have problem all of they own . the first and many obvious	difficulty	be that a three - dimensional object cannot fit satisfactorily on to a flat page . different view of a sculpture can be present , but you cannot move round a sculpture except with a film camera . there be also the problem of settings .
clearly artist work in several medium have a wide range of reference . the art critic be thus bind to consider with care what standard of comparison should be use . in the late twenty century artist work in performance pose	difficultie	for the critic , though some observer find it refresh rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture . in sum , then , the monograph be a major site for art critical write , and , moreover , the place where the much extended criticism be likely to appear . the reader may be disappoint by the standard of what be write , but unlike other site of criticism , this cannot be attribute to the form of publication , only to the limitation of the author .
lucky for the curious , this historical sideline can be follow up in a number of publication , both about individual and institution . the authentication of work of art from other part of the world can be problematic . for african art , say , the	difficultie	be complicate by lack of write or other corroboration , and knowledge that extensive copy have be do . theft of art work be also an international problem , especially poignant in the case of object with cultural and religious significance . occasionally auction contain item so intereste that critic in newspaper comment on they quality , not just the price they might fetch .
divide into national school , in separate publication , the gallery also publish short guide , souvenir guide , book of detail , a complete photographic record of the picture , specialist publication on conservation , and educational material . the keystone of the arch of publication must be the catalogue it , from which the authority of other write derive . the catalogue of the early italian school be write by martin davie , and publish in 1951 . the strength of the gallery 's holding of work by giovanni bellini make it worth the author 's while to write a preliminary note about	difficultie	of attribution : a definition of bellini 's oeuvre be one of the hard problem in the history of paint . the first difficulty be , despite the destruction , the enormous number of exist picture , many of they sign , and in one way or another very or less bellinesque .
for example , this passage in an article on giacometti by the american critic hilton kramer : shape a figure or a head from the scrutiny of the model who sit before he , be feel to be an impossible assault on an objective guaranteed to elude he grasp this	difficulty	be the moral center of he art , the very fulcrum of he style . to it we owe that nervous , spidery line of the drawing so quick , so attentive , yet so despair that alert we to the elusiveness of the subject at the same time that it persevere in the attempt to render it . the article , call giacometti 's moral heroism , be about a retrospective show of the sculptor 's work ten year after he death ; it do not include the name of any single work .
in person , incidentally , diderot be an encourage critic . sainte - beuve tell we that david always speak of diderot with gratitude . it seem that david have at first great	difficulty	in make he way with the public , and be several time unsuccessful in he effort after fame . it be at this time that diderot , who often stroll into the artist 's studio , pay a visit to david , and see a picture which the artist be just finish . he admire it and talk about the artist 's mean , and the noble idea he attribute to he .
a list can even rise to evoke the mood of a picture , as in this description by the goncourt brother of chardin 's subject ; he introduce into he picture he wash - basin , he mastiff puppy , the object and the creature to which he be accustom in he home the pure simple feature of the work middle class , happy in it tranquillity , it labour and it obscurity . the genius of the painter be the genius of the home . people in picture can be very problematic to describe , since they may not be identifiable , a special	difficulty	with portrait . the activitie of people in picture can be equally puzzle . indeed , if the story enact in a picture be not know , quite wrong inference can be draw from what be perceive .
in see african sculpture reproduce , the reader can remember that this art be to an extent be misrepresent by photography . secondly , the formal analysis which be second nature to a western critic can be fruitful , even though it could be argue that this be a way of interpre the object of an unfamiliar culture rather than a description . a further type of	difficulty	arise in description of work produce in far eastern culture . while a western eye be familiar with the process of look , as it be , through an image to what it represent or means , an eastern critic look also at the surface of a paint or a drawing , in which a poem or other calligraphic element may form an integral part of the work . chinis paint and calligraphy be visual art on much of an equal foot .
perception how a spectator view an object be also not a simple matter , despite this century 's increase knowledge of the psychology of perception . a	difficulty	be that psychology have narrow term of reference which can give only a few useful result , for example on the question of illusion . a classic example of exposition , though not uncontroversial , be e . h . gombrich be art of illusion . this useful explore some of the resolvable question , in particular that of crucial interest to student of landscape and the human figure .
in an evaluation the critic may put personal feeling aside . what be an aesthetic experience the question have puzzle generation of western historian , critic and philosopher for at little two century because of the	difficulty	of disentangl the aesthetic from other response . a pragmatic view be that an aesthetic experience be what be descri as such , and as there be variety of religious experience , so there may be variety of aesthetic experience . let we join an american educationalist talk to child about they understand of art .
it be rog fry 's contention that an object , say a bunch of carrot on a market stall , could be view in a practical way as something to eat for supper , or aesthetically . this distinction can be back up by philosophy and aesthetics , and description can be find of the resultant moment of vision or epiphany . we concern , however , be not with the	difficultie	of aesthetics , but only with what a critic write of aesthetic experience , and how useful such an account may be . this be an aspect of description , while it can be suggest that other religious , political or social concern be very properly matter of interpretation . unfortunately it be often the case that swrite do not allow they to be so free in autobiographical disclosure as to say exactly how they feel on see some work of art .
this lucid and cando prise , strong in the detail of a particular time and place , often ignore , and can on occasion seem to depart from , the sense of the literature it embody . the offended look of the muzzy black citoyen who be put in to own salim 's store when trade be politicise be funny , and important , and owe nothing to the aeneid . but that who would prefer to explain the book as a comedy of manner , or as current affair , might have	difficulty	in explain the prominence give to the love affair . the plot state that an attachment to a strange woman , a woman who do not belong to this community of stranger , be succeed by a return to the community , and by the dispersal , and survival , of the community . salim state that he be have a rough time , and be tired and suspicious of yvette : he do not say that a tribal god command he to leave she .
but the raconteur of the extra - literary world be permit to shape and turn the speech of the character in they storie , and to play the pervasive evident author . and anyone who doubt whether the method can safely be transfer to literature should consult one of amis 's good novels , end up . raconteur and raisonneur , in he art as in he personal life , he be a concealed author who be evident enough in he hot opinionate fiction : he be not give to expound he own passionate opinions there , but can be recognise without	difficulty	in almost every aspect of every one of he novel , include the speech assign to he often disputatious character . there be a sense in which each novel of he be an opinion of he , coextensive with the work it and rather hard , as a rule , to read off in summary . this consideration affect the difficulty which attend difficulty with girl , and which come to the fore with the many amis - sound of it character , the male lead .
the status of comedy be crucial to the debate , and we can at little be sure that kingsley amis would not object to have he practice compare with waugh 's , or to be place with he among the monologist of the right . against this monologic amis can be set , by way of alter ego , the modernistic amis of barbara everett 's discussion of difficulty with girl , which occur in the course of an essay on hugh kenner 's fantasy of a british betrayal of modernism , and which spring the surprise of convey that amis , so often suppose an enemy of modernism , be really a modernist . she begin by recall a remark make to she a long time ago by larkin , about	difficultie	encounter in he private life a remark which consist of a joke to do with the impossibility of relation between man and woman , follow by the notion that woman ought really to marry each other , follow by but that would be wrong , would not it and she note that the same remark , or the same sentence , can be find in amis 's novel . what interest she , apparently , be not the remark it , but the degree to which the piece of recall she piece of recall , presumable fail to affect the novel in any way .
there be still that who prefer to take they chance in the profession without any formal training . this use to be a lot easy to do than it be now : for one thing , work in the profession mean that you have to belong to the actor 's union , equity . yet student who have complete expensive train face the same	difficultie	as an untrained actor in qualify for an equity card . this question be discuss late in the book , but it be still relevant to the potential drama student . become an actor have to be think of in realistic term right from the begin and all possible problem do need to be face .
it be the last day of the old tradition , i suppose and i be glad i be lucky enough to be part of they . now there be no guarantee that a career actual exist and equity be not make it all any easy for the new young actor to establish they . and with the theatre run into	difficultie	about subsidy it be not get any very hopeful . a.r in fact the dream that we all have about great britain acknowledge it be theatre and fund it properly have suffer a lot of setback since the sixty .
it should be not that the large threat to totalize control of school in ireland have so far come from the integrate schooling movement . this movement have a double constituency , one in the northern , the other in the southern , state . they membership , mainly middle - class , have meet considerable	difficulty	in try to achieve they limit goal integrate school for the child of that parent who wish it though some of the membership in the early day be aim at a total integration of the schoole system . until recently , catholic in the north be practically forbide by they clergy to attend state school , exception be make in certain outly area . bishop edward daly in derry liberal interpret the need of he roman catholic pupil from the mid - 1970 , allow great freedom and see to it that some alternative religious education be provide .

i say nothing , but turn away and walk as quickly as i could toward the stair and down to the student cantee in the basement . i desperately need a cup of coffee . i can see that i may have a little	difficulty	explain this first part of i story , especially to anyone not acquaint with the often bizarre ritual of academic life . let i first explain charle howard . he have become director of the school at the start of that academic year .
traditionally , it be usual to take the upwind wing - tip and to hold it slight below the horizontal . this be because with the old glider like the t21 or t31 , the wing be very high and they could not be hold secure except by keep one wing low . however , when tow in a cross wind , the glider will tend to weathercock into wind , and the person on the upwind wing will have	difficulty	in push forward enough to prevent this happening . with a modern glider which have a low wing and the wheel well ahead of the c.g . , this weathercock will be even much pronounce , so it be good to hold the down wind tip . ( just as with the cross wind take - off , the down wind wing should be hold so that any slight pull will not help the weathercock into wind . )
however , they mean that the pilot have to be prepare for a possible launch failure or cable break on every flight . launch failure account for a very high proportion of glid accident , make cable break practice a very important aspect of glid training . much student have very little	difficulty	in learn how to make satisfactory launch . however , the critical few moment at the start of the launch be not always fully understand , and often there be an element of luck in get it right . instructor can be mistaken about they student 's ability to control the initial part properly if one or two launch go well .

he comment specifically on this and he use of the faulkner quotation by say , when the write have some urgency to speak , the subject matter become almost irrelevant . somehow he feeling become detach from the critical procedure ( not that he do not handle and assess he own work critically , which he do ) . he feel something ; be inspire by it ; he mind take off ; he period flow and afterwards he have	difficulty	in recall they point of origination , even they exact mean ( like brown , see below ) . he experience be transmute into art . understand mythology thus , we might paraphrase he title : symbol of life , which have the additional benefit of thrust forward he debt to the surrealist poet lorca , a natural child of the symbolist movement , who super - realism have infatuate leonard from he teenage year .

that be sure putte it too high . but there be a salience problem here . _ that it be three - year - old who have	difficulty	with flavell 's appearance - versus - reality problem ; and indeed further experiment have show that there be a strong statistical correlation between performance on the appearance - reality and on the false belief task . where be the salience effect i would say that the child be capable very or less of recognize that other people have mental state different to he own .
for example , one can say of a brain process that it occupy a particular point in space or that it can be display on an oscilloscope screen ; wherea neither of this thing could be say of , for example , the subjective sensation of the colour blue or of the think that i hate monday morning . it be difficult to comprehend an object that be utterly unlike it . this , in fact insuperable ,	difficulty	be say to be overcome by propose that mental phenomena and brain process be the same stuff view within different theoretical framework . but this apparent escape be only another version of the dual aspect theory and inherit the latter 's problem . b ) how/why do the causal chain link object and perception have a begin and an end
the stress and strain on muscle and joint be considerable , but why have she not send the doctor 's certificate as a matter of courtesy to the tournament authority monica 's number one rank would have be at stake at wimbledon . grass be not she favourite surface and there be many who think she would have great	difficulty	hold off the challenge of steffi graf , martina navratilova or gabriela sabatini . i be sure that have nothing to do with she withdrawal but the way she do it raise very questions than it answer . i suspect that the rejection of the 7m offer by the all england club for the land of the wimbledon sport club opposite be not by any means the end of the story .

i mere include the note about adjustment for interest , whoever the maker might be . i know that jack be a master chairmaker and i admire what he do . he may regard i as an amateur but the fact be that , due to physical	difficultie	, i cannot pull and twist in a horizontal mode and so i invok gravity to assist . the derogatory remark that the rounder handle might strike the bench leg be uncall for . secondly , to paul clarke ( ww/may 91/p.452 ) ; do , please , read barry jackson 's book .
this be perhaps inevitable since deconstruction resist teleology , and it be this resistance that have enable it enemy to call it nihilist . leave intellectual content aside , there be an obvious contrast between norris 's manner , which be in the good english academic tradition , clear , cautious , attentive to evidence , move from one conclusion to the next , and derrida 's exuberant obfuscation . in he introduction norris acknowledge the	difficulty	of write about he at all in such a context : that he should now figure as an addition to the modern master series be yet another irony of derrida 's ascent to intellectual stardom . no philosopher have do very to disow the idea that he writing embody some kind of masterly or authoritative wisdom .
such division be not , so to speak , purely academic . they lead to confusion on the part of student , and it may be too glib to say , as one sometime hear , that such confusion and disorientation be an inherently desirable part of the educational process . it do not always work like that , for they can lead to real	difficultie	in study , and sometime to pastoral problem . iii one of lodge 's early novels , change place , hilariously exploit a series of typological opposition .
the american be professionals and swallow be an amateur , which , we recall , have the primary sense of lover . yet there be one sense in which swallow have thorough assimilate the professionalism of the academy . though he have	difficulty	in write anything for publication , he be a scrupulous and painstak examiner , and he own examination paper be careful ponder , fine draft works of art . he even dream of publish a concise , comprehensive survey of english literature in the form of examination questions : collect literary question , by philip swallow . a book to be compare to pascal 's pense or wittgenstein 's philosophical investigation .
yet it quasi - mystical element prevent it from fully use it potential . it be the heir of a nineteen - century ideology that , though supposed liberal and contemplative , be also litist , anti - vocational , antimarket , and indeed downright hostile to the idea that high education should prepare young people to take they place in a wealth - produce econoi . an excessively elevate sense of standard mean that there be	difficultie	. academics in english be slone reluctan to engage in team project or pull together in research centre . they can be irritatingly slow to publish , and it be often difficult to know how they spend they time .
on the bright side , there be that young and much active lecturer who do they duty and generate performance - indicator in the form of book and article . it be true that in some cas this publication may be of extreme radical tendency , attack the establish practice of academic english teach , but that be no objection , since it be the fact of publication that count , not it content . the real problem be that the writer of such text may make political	difficultie	within a department , or teach in way difficult for student to understand . again , english departments can be unhelpful about participat in scheme for train academics how to teach , claim that teach literature be less easy define and methodologize than teaching engineere or economic . at a time when a good public image be essential for university , english be unable to explain it in way immediately intelligible to the outsider , be notoriously riven with doubt and disagreement that prevent it from have a share sense of purpose , and may at interval erupt into crise that attract the wrong sort of publicity .
that be because cultural literacy be a canon of information not text . hirsch be trail he coat , but he be concern with what take place in society at large , not in college cours . yet within the context of organize literary study , it be true that much of the	difficulty	student have in make sense of text come from a lack of information , or to use the old term , a deficiency in general knowledge . as a scholar and theorist , hirsch be know , apart from he unfashionable but vigorously argue advocacy of intentionalism , for he conviction that literature be not a coherent concept , and have no definable essence , and that by extension english as a discipline have no absolute method . he believe that literary study have a cultural and humane rather than an intellectual value ; and the implication of he recent work be that there be other way of attain cultural value .
the much visible and vocal theorist have high energy and intelligence ; they also seem to find imaginative write rather bor before it be process into theory . the drift of i rhetoric might seem to be take i towards a traditional defence of literature , of the imagination , of creativity , of humane value in general . i believe profoundly in all this thing , it go without say ; i	difficulty	lie in know how defensible they be in the form in which they be visible institutionalize in the anglophone academy . i reflection be not encourag , though they be not altogether negative . the first line of defence of establish literary study against culturalist pressure be to emphasize literature as literature rather than as a version of philosophy , history , sociology , and so for .
one may choose to adopt a broadly aesthetic approach to text , as be often do , perfect appropriate , but one then encounter what seem to i a potentially disable contradiction . in practical pedagogy the student be encoura to read , careful , attentive , sensitive , a particular text . as we have see , there may be cultural barrier to such reading , but leave aside that potential	difficulty	, we invite the student to make a unique , personal response to the text , to tune in to the true voice of feel , to participate in it expressiveness ; in short , to have an aesthetic experience . this be true even of the seemingly tougher - mind cambridge approach . william have refer to a conception of literature as a series of author to who there must , must be personal evaluative response ' or it available facsimile .

as a professional carver i think it only natural to get i hand on one of that new arbortech woodcarver to add to i compendium of tool last year . i have no specific use at the time , but i think it would prive a handy addition to the workshop , and be delight when i grandfather elect to purchase the tool for i . sadly he die shortly afterwards and for many reason it be some month before i use the	disc	. the advent of the arbortech carve competition at the 1990 woodworker show give i the idea of put the tool to some good use . i grandfather have always take a keen interest in i work , and i have an equal admiration of the storie of he time spend in burma during the second world war .

such be the waste removal power of this sort of tool , that safety for the operator and workpiece must be consider . on a superficial level then , the supercut be the safer tool , slip whenever problem arise , though there be concern about the chain break . however , i find that in many instance this slip action make the	disc	useless , as it be unable to cut to any depth before it stop rotat . i have expect it to be good for trenching and shape in the vertical position , but on all but the softest of timber it fail to supply a substantial cut . conversely i discover that it could cut with the disc flat , or at a slight angle , and i can see it have benefit for very fine work .

and , for all the appeal of he sing and play , paul hipp come out pretty dull between the number . to camouflage the failure of the play , andy walmsley have create a set which resemble a pile - up of roadside hoarding : oldsmobile , van heusen shirt , texaco premium type . rob bettinson , the director , have deduce that he ought to have this image plus	disc	- jockey , radio commercial , midwestern hops , but he do not seem to know why . like many show which be manufacture with an eye to commercial success ( winnie , high society , to name only buddy 's predecessor at the victoria palace ) , this one will probably fail . it be not as if there be not aspect of he career that be not worth explor : how do he come to use drum , then almost unknown in texan country line - ups
viruse can also spread if computer be link by modem to the outside world . but user who do not have modem and keep they data hygienic by not borrow software have little to fear , mr keane say . the viruse often work by attack a section of the	disc	know as the boot section . this block of data include the index , and if the index be render useless then so be all the data on the hard disc . it cannot be recall in any coherent form .
i feel a strong feeling of nausea as i realise that i have put i hand through the chest of a dead british soldier that could have be lie in the ditch for several day . the body have be cover by a thin layer of soil as be the practice when a soldier be kill in action and there be no time to move he to the rear . before the dead soldier be place in the ditch he pay book , personal possessions , he equipment , and one of he identity disc be remove , leave one	disc	on the body for identification purpose . a light layer of soil be put over the body and the spot mark . if there be time , a roughly made cross be place at the head of the dead soldier hold he beret or steel helmet .

print circuit contain 10 million transistor be already available and will fit on a penny coin . penzia foresee that the number will have rise to a billion by the end of the century , with an untold gain in comput power . compact -	disc	technology for encod sound and other information have gain ground rapid and , penzia believe , optical fibre will soon supplant communication satellite . open access to all this vast capacity for generation of information create it own demand : in the us alone 18 million filing cabinet be manufacture each year to hold the paper output . perhaps the much allur prospect lie in artificial intelligence and computer that learn .
digital instrument still rely on university and research institute for about half of it sale . but the japanese have decide that anything with the slight chance of help to make good microchip deserve a close look . the company have sell to much big japanese chipmaker and many manufacturer of electronic and optical - storage	disc	. japanis industry now account for nearly a third of sale . other firm be profite too .
such a device be call an atomic - force microscope ( afm ) . although the afm cannot quite achieve the resolution of an stm , it be likely to have it use in microelectronics . optical	disc	, for example , be make of insulat material ; although they can be coat with a thin metal film and put under an stm , an afm could examine a product without destroy it . digital instrument will start deliver afm this spre , many to japanis optical - disc manufacturer . they hope to sell 100 by the end of the year .

yet tinseltown remain the undispute home of an industry who revenue be grow ( in real term ) at around 7 % a year . in 1990 , say jeffrey logsdon , an analyst at seidler amdec in lo angeles , american box - office receipt account for only 2.5 billion of the industry 's 7.8 billion in domestic income ; overseas market add a far 6 billion . new technology , like video	disc	, or new politics , such as the open up of eastern europe , have deliver new audience . if hollywood be about to crumple , then it be it own fault . tinseltown be a three - ty society .
about two year ago autobac clean up it oily - rag image . car owner need they wheel or battery change be now greete by man clad in bright orange uniforms and natty cap . at each outlet there be swanky retail space , use to sell every imaginable kind of car accessory , from compact -	disc	player and car television to design car seat , sporty steer wheel and even perfume to make leather seat smell sweeter . this make sense in japan where ( because of stellar house price ) much young single professional still live at home with they parent and have cash to spend , and where people do not make a habit of throw brick through car window and steale thing . consequently , for lack of a good alternative , the car have become the favour means of personal expression , or as an autobac seven director , kenzo kido , put it , the equivalent of life space .
mr kido say that almost 70 % of the company 's customer in the tokyo area be under the age of 29 . this specialist market be set to boom in japan , even though the market for new car be mature . there may be 32m car on the road in a country of 123m people but , as yet , only 6 % of they be fit with compact -	disc	player . autobac , which make a pre - tax profit of 7.3 billion ( 51.7m ) on sale of 110.4 billion in the year end march 31st , have the means to finance further expansion . shareholder 's equity of 44.6 billion represent nearly 60 % of total asset .
the technology that have be substitut for human life on the wide scale be that of the microprocessor . just as microchip have infiltrate the home and office , so they have invade the battlefield . the difference between today 's weapon and that of the second world war be not unlike that between a 1940s gramophone and a compact -	disc	playou , arm with a laser and stuff with chip . it do the old job much good and some new job too . although microchip give machine only a smidgen of intelligence , that can go a long way when sensible apply by human master .
a tower may seem round from a distance , but there be no need to doubt we closer observation that it be square . sometimes , moreover , experience can show that we reason be superficial and incorrect , as when we learn from it that , despite what we might think , an arrow fir upwards from a moving ship will not fall behind but back on to it . at other time , however , reason can correct the appearance of sense ; from the waxing and wane of the moon , according to how it be illuminate by the sun , we can deduce that it be a globe , and not the flat	disc	it appear to be . furthermore , as when we infer from observe sweat the existence of pore in the skin , reason can lead we from what can be perceive to what cannot . gassendi 's empiricist view on the derivation of we idea from sense - experience , on natural philosophy and it foundation in careful consider observation , and he stress on the explanatory value of epicurean atomism , be already well know to hobbe and other when they be formally introduce into england via the publication , in 1654 , of walter charleton 's physiologia epicuro - gassendo - charltonia : a fabrick of science natural upon the hypothesis of atom , found by epicurus , repair by petrus gassendus , augment by walter charleton .
considerable skill be require in the make of corduroy , work - class fabric or not . craftsmen painstakingly cut the warp , one rib at a time , with long , knife ; then they brush it to make the pile stand up . today , of course , the process be mechanize ; four hundred razor - sharp cut	disc	slice much than a yard of cloth in one swift pass . one advantage of corduroy , aside from it warmth and comfort , be the richness it give colour . the piled fibre absorb and reflect the light , alternate deep and pale hue and give the cloth it unique lustre .

in the first example there be a white outer skin of pure silver , with overlapp join at each end . between this and the core be an alloy of copper and silver ( light grey in the photo ) . this be a solder attach two	disc	of silver foil cup around the copper core like the foil wrapper around a chocolate penny . the second example have no join in the outer skin , only a copper - silver alloy coat , indicate that it be plat with molt metal rather than foil . the mercury method , so popular in the roman period for gild , can also be use for silver bronze and brass .
x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) analysis ( see glossary ) be ideally suit to this sort of probley as it require only a minute sample and , much important , it identify the mineral or compound present . xrd be able to identify the metal sulphide use to make the niello and to distinguish it from the metal and from the oxide , chloride and carbonate corrosion product which contaminate the sample . thus , where element analysis by x - ray fluorescence of the inlay on two silver anglo - saxon	disc	brooch show both to have a major component of silver , with some copper and sulphur . xrd analyse identify one inlay as silver - copper - sulphide ( agcus ) and the other as silver - sulphide ( ag 2 s ) contaminate with copper carbonate ( cuco 3 . cu ( oh ) 2 ) from the corrod base silver alloy of the brooch .
archaeological unit be also be tempt by the impressive capability of geographic information system , which in essence allow map to be store , display , overlay and update on a computer screen . las light can now give we very than just music in we ear . compact disc can store data too , and act as a superb archive medium for large database , while videodisc give instant access to thousand of high - quality photographic image on one 14 - inch	disc	. far in the future , las light look set to replace electricity it , drive computer a hundred time faster than the fastest now available . development in the world of comput move close to the speed of light .

the 1.5 - litre inject engine with catalytic converter deliver 82bhp . it be lively , flexible and responsive a little noisy perhaps but not annoyingly so . clutch and gear be slick and smooth confirm it japanese pedigree and the front	disc	and rear drum brake be light and positive . on the road it handle well . the ride be on the firm side but no very so than some of it rival and good than other .
what be interesting about the system be that the driver can decide for he by press a button whether or not he want to use this feature . for instance , he can choose to work with the 4wd and diff - lock in the usual way both function have they own button and can be engage and disengage under full load . brakes be fit to both front and rear wheel and involve oil - immerse	disc	. they be , not surprise , hydraulically operate and certainly seem to work very well . monitor
you can buy a car without a cat , but it cost very . good market buy nothing for something . brakes be now all -	disc	with abs standard on the 2.2 . and replace on - demand 4wd be a full - time system , which use a central viscous coupl to apportion drive as need and prevent wind - up . performance , economy
they be relatively cheap , but need engine rpm to deliver full output and be good when handle one operation at once . close - centre system be very expensive to build , less sensitive to engine rpm , less wasteful of engine power , have sharper response and can cope good with simultaneous demand . brake be either wet	disc	or drum . wet brake be always within an axle ; dry brake may be internal or external . wet brake offer long service life through oil immersion and be not affect by external water .
the first piece , however , be make at the local syrian mint , at antioch . the study of punch coin be make by the process of strike a blank	disc	or flan of metal between two die ( see fig 1 and 2 ) . this die be usually make of bronze or steel , and bore the design in intaglio . in the ancient world this die be engrave by hand , but from the early medieval period punch begin to be hammer into the die to make up the design .
and for this reason we be look for a suitable name . the company be call tlmondial but this be nothing to do with television or ordinary video . so we be look for a new name that we shall use for the	disc	when they be eventually release . ro you have over dm 50 million tie up in the project but you be very patient about the eventual time of launch .
when that final come to a crisis i be within four day of complete paralysis . i have not be kind to i back ; i have accident when i be a boy , tree - clim and bik , and i have spend many year ski . the	disc	that slip have do so in such a way as to be dig into i spinal chord . it have compress two - third of the marrow and trap the nerve . they take five hour to get it out ; and there be a man in the next room who be not so lucky as i be .
but for now kylie harness it to press on with the next stage of she ten year plan which have be draw up by she musical gurus . stock , aitken and waterman launch a two month promotional tour of the world in london with a glitter party . the champagne reception at which kylie begin to demonstrate for the first time a new found confidence with both press and public also give they the perfect opportunity to milk they golden child 's late achievement , three uk gold	disc	for kylie the lp , and the single i should be so lucky and get to be certain . from there she go on a punish schedule of visit to the us , scandinavia and japan before return to australia , which still remain very much she home . i suppose there might be a day when i would move away from australia as i permanent base , she say .
the moon effect it be generally agree that object appear small and heavy as they move upwards . the moon effect can be test with a torchlight on a dark night and , sure enough , the light	disc	appear to get small and much intense as it rise . this effect have eimmediat graphic , sculptural and architectural application . typeface at the top of a page of a newspaper need to be large than that lower down .
mller - thurgau be the grape variety , an early ripening and high flavoure variety , much favour along the upper rhine . for scheibenbuck i have not a clue , though it be probably the name of the vintner . scheibe be a wheel or	disc	and bcken be the transitive verb for to bend so i would like to think it mean wheel - buckler though i great doubt it . i revise i estimate of the mother that eve when an elderly man arrive , one of who arm be in a sling . she cut up he dinner for he in a charming , solicitous way .
jury , audience and critic ( include i ) be overwhelmingly pro vengerov , whether he be perform bach , beethoven or paganini . he be not yet 20 , but he technical control , confidence , brilliance and intellectual depth display an outstand maturity . two new	disc	bring this qualitie to the fore . the orchestral one with the israel philharmonic and zubin mehta feature what might be loosely call display piece . it need a special artist to sustain such a programme , and the wonderful thing about vengerov 's play be that in , say , the paganini first concerto , one can sit back and take the accomplishment for grant , acknowledge that he can overcome any paganinian hurdle , and simply relish the way he actual make something of the music .
the feeling be genuine . and waxman 's carman fantasy take on a dimension of passion rare hear in such an undisguised pot - pourri entertainment . the recital	disc	with the pianist alexander markovich reveal vengerov as a significant interpreter both of beethoven and of brahm . again , the play have that energy , that vocal quality which make the music speak directly and moving . the singe line , the sense of momentum , of progression toward and relaxation from climax be gauge with a natural feel for the musical contour and the poetic expressiveness of both sonata .
everything from there that i need , i carry within i . viktoria mullova play at the barbican tomorrow at 4pm the art : recycle jewel alan blyth welcome on to c much great performance from the age of black	disc	by alan blyth the companies ' recycl at mid - price of back catalogue continue apace with notable benefit to the consumer .

the mono recorde hardly show it age and the play be gorgeous ( 425 9932 ) . krauss 's direction of the other strauss 's die fledermaus be another irreplaceable set , now come up fresh - mint ( 425 9902 ) , with julius patzak as the much beguile of all eisenstein and wilma lipp a delightfully coquettish rosalinde . a bonus on this	disc	be a new year 's concert of strauss waltze in which krauss be a master . the same series feature george szell in vital and refin accounts of brahm 's third symphony and dvorak 's eighth with the concertgebouw ( 425 9942 ) , reading to lift the heart . klemperer 's live account of mahler 's kindertotenlieder with the same orchestrum may not be in such good sound , but with kathleen ferrier as soloist this be another important document , and it be coupl with an unrival version of brahm 's liebeslieder - walzer from the 1952 edinburgh festival .
a favourite composer of beecham 's be berlioz , so it be good to have back in circulation he famous 1957 performance of the symphonie fantastique with the french national radio orchestra ( cdm7 64032 2 ) coupl with the overture k lear , make with the rpo , and the pre - war and still vivid carnival romain with the lpo ; even if the recording of the last be a bit confin . all show the conductor 's empathy with the composer display in lyrical line and incandescent climax , poetry and fire nicely balance . complet this issue be vivid accounts of other beecham favourite , franck 's d minor symphony and lalo 's in g minor ( cdm7 63396 2 ) , both with the french national radio orchestra , and a	disc	of lollipop ( cdm7 63412 2 ) with the rpo . this be all stereo original and sound as fresh as the day they be make . em i be great recording of the century feature two disc of british music conduct by beecham 's near - contemporary , sir john barbirolli .
meanwhile , leonard bernstein be be celebrate by sony in a remastering of it huge archive of the conductor 's recording . this be entitle the royal edition with a somewhat odd market ploy painting by prince charle on the front of each cd . the	disc	be to be issue in alphabetical order of composer : the first tranche include some bartok , the nine beethoven symphony , the brahm symphony and works by bernstein he . not to be overlook be em i 's reissue of vittorio gui 's glyndebourne set of rossini 's opera il barbiere di siviglia ( cms7 64162 2 ) , la cenerentola ( cms7 64183 2 ) and , good of all , the late comedy , le comte ory ( cms7 64180 2 ) . to all of this gui bring an elan that keep the high spirit bubbl delightfully .
the play be truly memorable , the record faithful . it be an expensive issue , though , 82 minute of music spread over two full - price cd . some rival issue add another work and other get the symphony into one	disc	. whether one agree with he view of a work or not , bernstein be never dull . of so many recording issue this day one might say , it be perfect good , but be it necessary , because of a lack of character and musical insight .
it have it pointer to the future , but i would have forgiven any vienna professor in 1876 who fail to predict what be to follow . mahler need to become a conductor of other man 's music before he become a real composer . but this be a delicious	disc	, contain not only a winn performance of beethoven 's early septet but the first recording of a trifle call hymn to the veneration of the great joachim . this be a waltz for two violin and double - bass compose for the violinist 's 22nd birthday in 1853 by an uncharacteristically unbuttoned 20 - year - old brahm , under the pseudonym gioseppo . today i suppose he will have write variation on happy birthday , but this be much fun .
much live recording show gunther wand as classicist and modernist with the north german radio symphony orchestra . in schubert 's great c major symphony , he present a boult - like long view of this inexhaustible masterpiece , savour the sense of adventure that must accompany any worthwhile exploration of it . a companion rca	disc	contain four 20 - century works , the earliest ( 1913 ) , be webern 's five piece , op 10 , polish epigram , and the late , fortner 's interlude from he opera blood wedd ( 1957 ) , which sound much old than the webern . between they come stravinsky 's dumbarton oaks concerto and frank martin 's petite symphonie concertante , a work that grow in stature with every hearing , especially when conduct and play as well as it be here . yet none of this work can rival , for sheer novelty and strangeness , sibelius 's sixth symphony , still one of the much mystify and mesmerise orchestral utterance of the century .
the disc be fill out with the tone - poem pohjola 's daughter and en saga , the latter ( i always think ) just five minute too long . abbado 's late disc as karajan 's berlin successor be devote to brahm : cogent and altogether admirable performance of the four symphony and haydn variation to join the many other of which the same could be say . what make this	disc	wor have be the setting for chorus and orchestra of schiller 's nanie , compose in memory of a friend . this be brahm at he many radiant and affect , music of such intimacy that one be not surprise to learn that it suitability for public performance be questioned . elgar must have know it .

the disc record invent by berliner be the first to possess this advantage , since they could be stamp out almost like print . they also permit a much simpler reproduce machine , since the groove it propell the soundbox , no additional screw mechanism be necessary ( 7 ) . at first , the play time for both	disc	could be make in different size , all of which could be play on the same machine , be another advantage . in 1901 it be find that a ten - inch disc ( play for three minute ) be good for many type of music , even popular song , and the popular single be bear . although cylinder manufacturer countere effective for some decade , first with mould technique and late with fi groove , the overwhelm simplicity of be able to press thousand of copy of disc record and play they on a simple machine eventually tell in the disc 's favour .
they also permit a much simpler reproduce machine , since the groove it propell the soundbox , no additional screw mechanism be necessary ( 7 ) . at first , the play time for both disc and cylinder be the same about two minute but the fact that disc could be make in different size , all of which could be play on the same machine , be another advantage . in 1901 it be find that a ten - inch	disc	( play for three minute ) be good for many type of music , even popular song , and the popular single be bear . although cylinder manufacturer countere effective for some decade , first with mould technique and late with fi groove , the overwhelm simplicity of be able to press thousand of copy of disc record and play they on a simple machine eventually tell in the disc 's favour . certainly it become economic to pay record artist large fee ; and without mass - production , few recording of top artist would survive in playable form today .
any account of this milestone have to bear both application in mind . it do not take long for engineer to realise they could use very than one microphone , and balance the music internally . indeed , the illustrate london new show that gue merriman 's experiment have include several microphone and a selector system , but the surviving	disc	show no sign of active mix . before long , engineer be perform sound - mix function hitherto the responsibility of the conductor or musical director . one of the earli collaborator be the conductor leopold stokowski , who happily agree to experiment to divide the philadelphia orchestra into individually mike sections for increase clarity , presumable in search of something much like the clarity he perceive from the conductor 's rostrum ( 14 ) .
experiment in paris involve transmission by telephone line date back to 1881 , but it need the technology of the 1930 to record two channel with adequate fidelity , synchronization and separation . once again , stokowski and the philadelphia orchestra be in the forefront . two excerpt from scriabin 's poem of fire be record on stereo	disc	on 12 march 1932 . this be follow on late date by other experimental recording . as far as we know , they all use two or three microphone space some yard apart along the front of the orchestra , a technique favoure by american engineer to this day .
it be issue in 1973 . meanwhile , alan blumlein of em i in britain be work in ignorance of development in america ; he concept be to record two optical channel on cine film . but when delivery of the required four - ribbon light valve be delay , he turn to	disc	recorde so he could have permanent record of he experiment . this work be in some way inferior to that done in america , where engineer have develop a disc - cutter with good frequency - range and low distortion , and they pressing have low surface - noise as well . but blumlein invent a completely different microphone technique , the coincident technique ( 17 ) , and show how compatible mono recording and 45/45 stereo disc ( eventually adopt as the world standard in 1958 ) could be obtain with the technique .

but when delivery of the required four - ribbon light valve be delay , he turn to disc record so he could have permanent record of he experiment . this work be in some way inferior to that done in america , where engineer have develop a disc - cutter with good frequency - range and low distortion , and they pressing have low surface - noise as well . but blumlein invent a completely different microphone technique , the coincident technique ( 17 ) , and show how compatible mono recording and 45/45 stereo	disc	( eventually adopt as the world standard in 1958 ) could be obtain with the technique . and , when the light - valve be final deliver in 1934 , he make some stereo variable - area optical soundtrack almost identical to that adopt by the film industry in the late 1970 . 17 the first stereo microphone .
the 1930 be also a time for experimental long - play record . but what one mean by the first lp depend very much on you definition of lp ; long - play record of various type date back to the 1900 , as we shall see late . the stimulus in the 1930 be , again , the cinema ; for patent reason , some studio prefer to distribute they film with separate	disc	soundtrack , rather than have the sound print optically on the film it . to match a 1000ft reel of film which run for a little over eleven minute , a 78rpm turntable have to be slowe to 33 1/3rpm ( 18 ) . this speed be then adopt for victor 's first long - play record of 193134 .
18 early film - projector . this machine be use in cinema in the late 1920 . it reproduce the soundtrack from a	disc	record underneath the lamp house . both the projector and the turntable be power by the same motor to ensure they run at the same speed . projectionist have to be very careful to orientate the disc and to put the pickup in the right groove for the sound to be in synchronism .

but before tape come along , the record industry come up with one much development full frequency - range record . the idea of a record system cover the full range perceive by the human ear date back to 1925 , when brunswick claim they electrical recording cover the range from 16hz to 21000hz ( 19 ) . however , survive	disc	show the upper limit be much like 4000hz , inferior to western electric 's 4500hz . by 1934 the high frequency which could reliable be record have reach 8000hz . in 1940 the british decca company be ask by raf coastal command if it could record frequency up to 14000hz , almost the limit of human hear .
this model be first exhibit at the german radio exhibition in august 1934 . it could record upon normal recorde tape , comprise a coat of ferric oxide on a non - magnetic base . despite some significant development by bbc and marconi engineer , the system still do not give good quality than 78rpm	disc	; it only succeed because it give long run - time , and it have low running - cost because the tape could be magnetically erase and reuse . it be a combination of invention that prove to hold the secret to quality . the two much important be iron - oxide coat plastic tape ( first produce in germany in 1934 ) ( 22 ) and ultrasonic alternate - current bias ( patent by carlson and carpenter in the usa in 1921 ) .
so the two invention be not combin until 1940 . shortly afterwards , listener monitor german broadcast become aware that hitler could not be broadcast live from so many place at once . yet there be an absence of surface - noise which show that	disc	could not possibly have be use . the mystery be solve when the ally capture radio luxembourg in 1944 , where they find a new type of magnetic tape recorder combin the two invention already mention . it performance exceed that of contemporary disc .

he simpl dolby b system be adopt for tape cassette in 1971 , and be the main reason why this format become so popular as a means of disseminat commercially prerecord material . although even the good tape cassette could not outperform the good lp , they be much very rug , and do not develop annoy clicks . by 1985 sale of tape cassette be outnumber	disc	sale , although it have take 40 year for the advocate of magnetic record to see this come about . digital sound and the future in little than a century the world of sound - record have expand from a plaything for amateur to a world - wide billion - dollar industry , and it look set to stay that way .
by 1982 , sony 's system , use it u - matic videocassette for store 16 - bit digital audio ( with a potential signal - to - noise ratio of some 96 decibel ) , have become an industry standard . meanwhile , philip in holland have be pioneer the use of laservision videodisc , the little unsuccessful of several type of disc for carry video film . this be play by a beam of las light rather than a stylus , and philip see that combin digital audio with laser	disc	technology would be a great improvement upon the dolby cassette and the lp . the compact digital disc ( cd ) come on the market in 1982 , and have now practically replace the lp as a distribution medium . 16 - bit audio have a signal - to - noise ratio which comfortable exceed the full dynamic range of an orchestra , so it become possible to record orchestral music without any need to compress it dynamic range .
of course , this worry the record company , because the potential for piracy be great . at the time of write it seem that digital tape recorder sell to the public will have various anti - piracy measure buil into they for this very reason . on the other hand , error - correction please the record producer , because compact digital	disc	sell in the shop sound exactly like the master - tape in the studio . and archivist like it , because if the medium carry the recording have a limit life , it be possible to copy the sound to another medium without any degradation take place . in practice , all medium do have a limit life .
in practice , all medium do have a limit life . a search be now under way to find a medium with a reliable long shelf - life , because even if we present - day sound recording last for a full century ( which be doubtful ) , we successor will have to copy the whole collection every hundred year or so . for analogue sound - record , experience have show that the metal master use in the process of press	disc	copy have a very long life . but this be a very expensive way of preserve sound , only tolerable when hundred of copy be likely to be sell to cover the cost . in addition , the business of cutt a master be a high skilled craft , and at present it be a die art .
there be no impetus to develop anything very sophisticate than a spoken announcement or a separate piece of paper pack into the box . this mean that many cylinder record survive today have high dubious provenance , as we shall see late . it be debatable whether it be the cylinder or the	disc	that be the first to have a formal label physically attach . at the 1890 convention of local phonograph companies in chicago , delegate ask for a long cylinder with a section specifically set aside for an announcement , but this do not come about . the follow year there be a visit to the edison works at west orange , where the delegate see prerecord cylinder make by an experimental moulding process .
the only doubt concern the date ; it seem this early record could be from any year between 1889 and 1891 , so whether edison or berliner be actual first to make record with a label be open to debate . the conventional paper label be never possible on a cylinder , since there be insufficient flat space . the end of the cylinder box have to suffice ( 27 ) , and paper label be not attach to	disc	until 1901 ( 28 , leave ) . it should be point out that they be nearly always press into the disc at the time of manufacture , not past on afterward ; so the paper and ink have to be able to withstand high temperature . this be one reason why metallic ink , such as gold or silver , be common .

this be one reason why metallic ink , such as gold or silver , be common . in late year , paper label serve another function : they act like gasket , prevent molt material from get into the mechanism for punch the centre hole . half a century late , when vinyl	disc	become the norm , there be another complication . vinyl require great temperature in the press , and the molt material flowe with much less viscosity . so if ordinary paper label curl up during the manufactur process , they would take the vinyl with they , result in a warped disc .

this be not only design to withstand the heat without soak up liquid vinyl like blott - paper , but it be supply with a distinctive pattern on the back to indicate the direction of the paper grain . when two label be insert in the press with they grain at right - angle , any tendency for the paper to distort in one direction in preference to the other be neutralize . 25 berliner	disc	label . no paper label be use ; instead the information be engrave into the master - disc and reproduce on every copy together with the sound . the title be the very last word scratch on the master , in this case loriley , a traditional german melody .
27 cylinder box . the end of cylinder box carry the near the cylinder format ever get to label . 28 paper label for	disc	. the left - hand record carry an example of the first type of paper label for disc , introduce in 1901 . the right - hand record carry an early example of a red label .
the idea of fill the engraving with white great add to the legibility , but the conventional cylinder ( just over two inch in diameter ) have insufficient space for much much than the title . this do not matter very much as cylinder soon find they right at the bottom of the class structure of recording , and not many feature artist worth name . as disc record take a great hold of the market , some cylinder company turn to	disc	; but many of they eschew paper label . path disc adopt the idea of fill the engrave letter with white ( 30 ) , but edison 's diamond disc do not ( 32 ) . incidentally , much disc manufacturer with double - sided disc call the two side a and b .

the act permit such stamp to be affix to the container , rather than the record it ; this be the only practicable way with cylinder . but the board of trade have a great deal of latitude to vary the precise detail of the arrangement , and insist that , for disc , the record should bear the stamp , not the sleeve . as it be difficult to make stamp adhere to record without paper label , by 1916 all	disc	companies be use they . 29 end of cylinder record , show the letter style use by different manufacturer . 30 path disc label .
as it be difficult to make stamp adhere to record without paper label , by 1916 all disc company be use they . 29 end of cylinder record , show the letter style use by different manufacturer . 30 path	disc	label . 31 ( a to j ) the gramophone company class system . all this record be twelve inch in diameter and be make by the gramophone company of great britain between 1920 and 1925 .
he be the first artist to insist upon royalty payment , and he contract stipulate that the record should be retail at 1.00 each . he make he recording in 1904 and dy a year late ; by 1925 they have be move to the historic catalogue . 32 edison diamond	disc	label . it be many year before the collection agency and the record companies trust each other . eventually print replica of stamp become acceptable to both side .
it be not so much the label which affect the collectability of early rock record , but the nature of this optional centre . until 1957 the decca group in great britain make a detachable piece in the shape of a triangle ( 35 ) . this triangle centre tend to fetch high price among collector , because they be pretty safe guarantee that the	disc	in question be actual manufacture during the golden year of rock n roll , and be not a much modern press . there be a similar consideration for product of britain 's other principal manufacturer , the emi group . it earli single have label print with gold ink ; this , too , tend to have a high value than late equivalent print in silver .
however , since in this situation customer never know what they be buy , the scheme do not last very long . ala , the big deception in gramophone history comprise serious music , which be for many year cut down , both in duration and instrumentation . the first symphony to be recorde be schubert 's unfinished publish on one twelve - inch	disc	by american columbium in 1911 . fortuitously , it very title make the short version acceptable under the trades description act ! but for the next decade or very , nearly all orchestral and instrumental music be issue in cut - down form , without any warning be give .
a sound archivist will want a recording which get close to the sound of the original master - tape . the right to presley 's sun recording be acquire by rca victor together with the right to the artist , and although it be now know that the tape in rca victor 's vault be not actual the 1955 original , they be extremely good copy , and all have be reissue on compact disc . thus collector can get back to the sound of the original master - tape far very closely than would be possible with any 1955	disc	, let alone a forgery of one . there be very few artist who genuine record attract price which justify forgery . in 1987 the black album of pop sing prince be withdraw before it be issue , and only a few genuine copy escape .
the black album , be a pure black sleeve ( apart from lettere on the spine ) , be also particularly easy to reproduce . there be three record which have defy the search of record - collector , and since no one alive today have example to compare they with , they would seem to be prime candidate for potential forger . two be schedule for issue as fonotipia 69000 and 69001 , single - side	disc	nearly fourteen inch across . they comprise two operatic arias sing by the tenor jean de reszke , which be know to have be record in paris on 22nd april 1905 . it be assume that de reszke be dissatisfy with test - pressing ; at any rate , neither be issue .
the above non - existent record be , as i say , obvious candidate for forgery , but the simple fact of they be make by obsolete technology make it less like that forgery will appear . there would have to be a high potential return to justify the trouble and expense . acetate	disc	be , for many year , the equivalent of wax cylinder before magnetic tape become universal . they be use by professional and keen amateur whenever a small number of tailor - make disc be require . i consider the much likely candidate for forgery be therefore an unknown cylinder or an unknown acetate disc in other word , a one - off , which would be difficult to compare with the genuine article , because there would be nothing with which to compare it .

( the golden disc of the beatle ' ' sergeant pepper 's be auction in 1982 for 14,300 , but of course that be not the only copy of the recording in existence ) .
long - play recordings three factor ( size , speed , and groove - pitch ) might be manipulate to make long - play record . and because	disc	be on the market for a long time , and attract much investment , there be a correspondingly large number of freak around . probably the first long - play disc record be make by the neophone company of london in 1904 ; they be twenty inch in diameter . the recording comprise uninterrupted performance of opera overture , but they cose ten shilling and sixpence each , and need an outsize turntable .
the recording comprise uninterrupted performance of opera overture , but they cose ten shilling and sixpence each , and need an outsize turntable . so customer spend they money on twelve - inch disc instead , and in fact i have never see a twenty - inch neophone record . the marathon	disc	of 1912 ( 48 ) be make in the usual ten - inch and twelve - inch diameter , but with fi groove . the idea be to record use hill - and - dale modulation , with the groove pack closer together because there would be no risk of overlap . in fact , the british inventor p . j . packman take the idea a stage far ; he develope a cutter for v - shape groove , rather than the u - shape groove then consider normal , so he get a deep groove at the same time .
the new disc be also hill - and - dale , record with a relatively fine groove - pitch of 150 line per inch , so a ten - inch side play rather long than usual ( about five minute ) . the groove be u - bottom with a radius of precisely 4.7 thousandth of an inch , and he reproducer be fit with the very first diamond styli , of exactly this size for minimum wear and surface - noise . but the groove be very shallow by normal	disc	standard , and to reduce the chance of the stylus be throw out of the groove , the record be make absolutely flat , and a full quarter of an inch thick so they would be sure to stay that way . they turn out to be practically unbreakable as well as hard - wear . when i visit the edison national historic site a few year ago , i guide tell i that the full resource of he employer ( the unite states government ) have fail to break one ; but to find out exactly what be inside the quarter - inch slab , they have borrow a diamond see and cut one in half .
this prove to many people 's satisfaction that edison 's re - creation be indistinguishable from the original . unfortunately , edison be not he a musician , and the technology he fathere be never use for mass - produce serious musical record . since 1910 he have be recorde	disc	in london , and raymond wile 's list of edison disc master ( publish in the talk machine review from august 1971 onwards ) show that many mouth - water recording of london opera - singer and other treasure be make . they be take to america for mass - production . it seem , however , that everything edison actual issue be american home - grown corn .
they be take to america for mass - production . it seem , however , that everything edison actual issue be american home - grown corn . 50 a twenty - inch path	disc	. this example play for 3 minute 10 second and weigh 2.2 kilogram . another long - play disc be the world record , invent in 1922 by noel pemberton - bill .
big cylinder allow this to happen without extra wear . but since all large commercially - make cylinder seem to have be copy from standard one , there be no increase in quality , only in volume . the principle that large cylinder will withstand much wear can also be apply to	disc	. in 1909 the path company , which have by then abandon cylinder , make they own twenty - inch monster . ( 50 ) .
they combin the two feature of flexibility and long - play time . a relatively thin piece of cardboard much like thick paper , really be coat on one side with a material call durium . because it be single - side , the groove pitch be double to allow two number on each	disc	. the same company also make a french language course and many advertise mini - disc . despite they apparent fragility , there be lot of example survive today , and collector be genuinely sorry when the series come to a halt after only forty - two week .
none of this unbreakable record succeed in displace shellac . actual , shellac be perhaps the little important constituent ; the much important be slate dust , who abrasive and gritty property be need for a rather unusual reason . as we see early ,	disc	permit simple and cheap record - player ; but the advantage be lose if the record - player have to have sapphire or diamond point make out of precious gem . so steel needle be often use instead . to make the needle fit the groove , the disc contain abrasive material , so the tip would be ground down during the first two or three revolution .
in the late 1950 , for example , listener have to learn how to listen to stereo . the two microphone technique mention early be then rival , and professional engineer and amateur could not easily switch from one to the other , much less judge absolute fidelity . 53 an unusual record combin the qualitie of a picture	disc	( on the back ) , with a special label design ( on the front ) . 54 an edison - bell picturegram of 1927 , an early attempt at audio - visual entertainment . the record tell a story , complement by a picture scroll .
bone , muscle and joint old bone be very brittle and be easy break . the	disc	between the spine shrink and harden . osteoporose be common , and be bad in woman ( see page 107 ) . joint suffer from general wear and tear and become stiffer and less well lubricate .

we stare in stun shock , realise that the pilot must have make one last superhuman effort not to come down right on we head , but then just could not manage that last few yard which would have bring they safely onto the runway . there be nothing to say and nothing we could do . it be a perfect summer dawn and the red flame match the red	disc	of the sun as it rise over the misty hedge . but life be not all drama and tragedy . there be also the lighter side to thing , like the day a high - rank raf officer pay we a visit from group headquarter , the reason for which escape i now .
moeri have never publish this hypothesis , however . he say that it need to be test . all might still have be well be it not for the rupture -	disc	on the vent above the reactor . moeri consider this disc unnecessary for he low - pressure reaction , but he say givaudan insist on they because they be fashionable on all they equipment at the time . rupture - disc , however , simply open and let all the pressure escape .

the sri lankan government have move to try to counter the criticism of it human right record . in november , a presidential task force on human right be set up , consist of senior figure close to president premadasa . it main function , however , appear to be to present a good	image	of sri lanka to the outside world . much promise be the inauguration in january 1991 of a commission of enquiry into new case of disappearance . this commission consist of five senior member of the judiciary and legal profession .
they be capable of assesse modern art in it own term , partly from experience gain through judge work of other period within quite different term . meyer schapiro , who have a specialist concern with romanesque art , be an open - minded historian of this sort . he wrote enthusiastically about the late work of arshile gorky : gorky 's atmosphere , veile the hard opaque wall of the canvas , evoke a nocturnal void or the vague , unstable	image	- space of the day - dream mind . and he remember the painter : i use to meet he much often in the museum and gallery fix in rapt contemplation of picture with that grave , searching look which be one of the beauty of he face .
william j . ivin be curator of print at the metropolitan museum from 1916 to 1946 . in how print look , first publish in 1943 , he wrote an elementary introduction to the appearance ( the outward and visible sign ) of print , and caution that : much of the time spend over it should be give to look at it picture . the caption material under two	image	read as follow : in the middle nineteen century , before photography be in general use , pilinski of paris be famous ( and notorious ) for the deceptiveness of he copy of old woodcut . this be an enlargement from an original fifteenth - century woodcut . on the opposite page be pilinski 's wood - engrave copy .
a successful description of a self - portrait may not be difficult , but an illuminat interpretation may call on many reference , especially other artist 's picture of they . what can be deduce from a self - portrait be often controversial ; a critic be especially likely to read into a self - portrait some opinion hold about the artist . when , as in the cas of rembrandt and van gogh , there be a whole series of picture to choose from , book can be write on the self -	image	of one artist alone . this theme be a useful one for assesse the quality of a critic 's write , since it tempt the rash into speculation , while an impoverished eye will miss relevant and useful comparison . a theme where personal psychology be necessarily absent be the christian subject of the madonna and child .
as in book on the philosophy of art , or aesthetics , many do not in fact contain any art criticism , in the sense of description , interpretation and judgement of individual work . they strength be rather in cleare the ground of preconceive idea about the art , and put new point of view . when work of art be descri only that aspect of an	image	important to the argument be include . it be in this arena that some of the fierce intellectual fight about art be take place , though the contest range wide than the visual art to politics and economic . for example , chadwick state : there can be no simple category define as feminist art history , since the effect of new idea be that much recend scholarly write have shift attention from the category art and artist to broad issue concern ideology of gender , sexuality , and power .
a far example of abstract form which be not mere pattern be tantric art . a tantric paint or draw have a spiritual purpose , to assist the user in meditation . as a sound be a mantra , so an	image	be a yantra , the two use together make a powerful combination for spiritual exercise . a description of a tantric paint as a linear diagram may seem uninterest , but then the effect of such a picture be not mean to be pleasure for the eye alone , but for religious use . way of describing
there be other way of description , which may incidentally be employ by a critic , or can be useful to a reader as a check on the validity of a verbal description . in chapter 4 , on monograph , there be some comments on the photography of art as a complement to criticism ; there be some other issue about how accurate or mislead photograph can be . perhaps this be the much important in the late twenty century now that this means of	image	- make be so familiar that some people actual imagine that a photograph show the world as it be . in truth , the camera be a ruthless editor of visual information ; this can be make plain by look at a picture , say of the eighteen century , and compare it with a contemporary print , perhaps an aquatint , and a modern photograph . the image carry different information .
after all , it be an original work in it . nevertheless , the difference between paint and print may be instructive , and help the interpretation of both . by other form of reproduction an	image	may be very or less degrade , so that nothing can be learnt from they . there remain the courtesy pay by one art to another , as in the poem which baudelaire suggest might be a high form of critical wri . or it may be music , as in mussorgsky 's composition which he entitle picture from an exhibition .
the testimony in the book be obtain mostly from the underling of the house , lead by sly , supportive bert , a man who be able to take and to give pleasure a fine portrait , which be also a self - portrait , of a second father . bert 's testimony , and ilse be , be probably paramount . the	image	she give of he as a boy , be one of dependency , extreme docility . it be i natural character , you think , evident from birth . ilse have be train in an orphanage , and he then tell she , with a smile : i would not claim any privilege that an orphan be not entitle to .
take , for example , the jewish question as it arise in the novel . patrick have be hire by an obnoxiously trendy mismate publisher . he labour scornfully for this simon giles , faint comforte by a corner in classical study which have be grant he for reason to do with the firm 's	image	. between patrick and mrs giles there flow , or gutter , a current of dreary sexual electricity . he fancy that simon be jewish , and that he give off a slight hot smell .
levi be an author who , without detriment to the other people who figure in he book , wrote all the time about he , both in autobiographical and in fictional form . the mode which he adopt be such as to license elision and lacuna , to enable he to leave out bit of he life a procedure which would seem to be connect with he scepticism about what can be know about people by biographer . in moment of reprieve he remark : what the true	image	of each of we may be in the end be a meaningless question . in the periodic table he mention a woman dear to i heart who be murder at auschwitz : but the book on auschwitz do not discuss he relationship with she . in the wrench he create the rig faussone , the practical man who crane girdle the world and who keep return , a little heavy - foot , to the house in turin where two old aunt fuss over he welfare : faussone be speak of as i alter ego , and the book have to struggle to accommodate he as a second person , available for interview by levi .
action , power , be think to be contrast , in babel 's story , with learn , devotion , resignation , suffer that jewish thing . he ambivalence be a bespectacled look at the long leg of the divisional commander , which be like girl sheath to the neck in shin riding - boot . the	image	summon by a narrator who exhaust dreams be fill with girl be like nothing we would ever meet in the literal levi . but the literal levi be a write who have he own way of intereste he in the contrast which have be attribute to babel . levi be interested in action , purpose , work , and capable of they : and the capacity may have be form in contention with a desire to withdraw and perhaps to give up .
kelman make doyle charm , and it be impossible to read the book without gain the sense of a fully - develop authorial fellow - feel . not that doyle be not tax and madden too . he consciousness deliver paranoid	image	of aggression and hostility . he be against racism and sexism , but be capable of reflecte : he be in love with alison houston . and he want to grab a hold of she .
act 1 , scene 4 comment this be a very well know piece , which need vivacity and spontaneity in presentation ; mercutio be enjoy he , weave he way through a fantastical set of	image	. the problem lie in sustain the speech , for mercutio be a hearty and boisterous character , seemingly at odd with the mischief and delicacy of this speech . would such a man talk of fairy like this
i begin work on the big glass on 27 july 1967 , wrote harsnet . goldberg ,	image	of they last meet in the narrow entrance of the elegant little scottish national gallery of modern art dance in he head , slip a sheet of a4 into he old olivetti portable and start to transcribe . i begin work on the big glass on 27 july 1967 , he type . i have be prepare i for that moment for a long time , he type , as harsnet have write .
and it have to be say , he wrote , that it opposite , a feeling of elation , equally physical , equally extra - physical , have also be a constant feature of i life , manifest it regularly though impossible to predict , a reeling in the chest this time , the chest and perhaps the throat , a feeling of the heart leap and the blood pump , it come when i first take up a brush and make a mark on paper , it come when i pick up the first readymade and feel it transform by that very action , it come when madge ring to say she could not go on , when annie wrote to say she be not come back , when the idea of the glass first pop into i head . so , wrote harsnet , there be continuity as well as discontinuity , but that do not mean , he wrote , that there exist what be call character , personality , character , goldberg wrote in the margin , personality , as they seem to think , wrote harsnet ( and goldberg go on type ) , when they say you have such a generous character if you would only recognize it , or you have so much to offer , or it be not for i i speak but for you , not for i i mourn but for the waste of all that generosity , when they pour that word over you , character , generosity , warmth , look sad , shedd tear , put on a brave face , say do not pay any attention to i , or , it be nothing , forget it , i be cry for the waste , mean waste if it be not directe towards they , but you have only to see what happen when one let one be persuade by that sort of thing , wrote harsnet , you have only to see what happen to hutchinson , macmahon , rollin and goldberg . take in by the	image	of you they presend you with , wrote harsnet , instead of wait in patience for the begin , instead of wait and then begin , though begin , have begin , he wrote , be not everything , be far from everything . it be quite possible , he wrote , that it will lead nowhere , even when one have begun at the right time in the right spirit , or at little not at the wrong time , in the wrong spirit , with the wrong plan and have make the wrong preparation , with the wrong tool and the wrong principle , on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception . though it may well be , he wrote , that one actual achieve very work with the wrong plan and in the wrong spirit , with the wrong tool and the wrong principle , on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception , it may well be , he wrote ( and goldberg type ) , that one achieve very than work with the right plan and in the right spirit , with the right tool and the right principle , on the right surface and with the right conception , though right and wrong and much and little be relative concept and what seem right at one moment to one person may seem wrong at the same moment to another person or at another moment to the same person , and what seem very to one person at one moment may seem less to another person at the same moment or at another moment to the same person , right , wrong , much , little , relative concept , scribble goldberg , in the margin , pant slight as he bend over he old olivetti portable , there be only the begin , wrote harsnet , or rather , there be only have begin , begin , scribble goldberg , aware now of the black stain on he hand leave by the felt - tip pen , have begin , there be only the feeling in the pit of the stomach or the feeling in the chest , wrote harsnet , the feeling of sickness or the feeling of elation , that be not relative , he wrote , that be absolute .
1 lb . onion , 1 lettuce ( co ) , 1 bag orange , 1 pack sugar , 1 pack salt . projection of another dimension or dimension as when the sun break through a cloud and wash - up powder , launderette , what else be jacob 's ladder he wrote , and goldberg , stare at he friend 's manuscript all that year late , type that in and put a little question mark in the margin of he typescript . before 1500 possible to put ladder into	image	, wrote harsnet ( type goldberg ) , no long so now . shadow of ladder yes , ladd no . dali 's error .
the density of the glass , he wrote . the intractability of the glass . have to get to grip with what this do to the	image	. it refusal to respond , as canvas and paper respond . try project negative of bride from holograph enlarger , he wrote , but image thin and weak where i want it strong ( though indeterminate ) .
where be the image where be the surface what be the status of the	image	shadow of another reality not imitation of shadow .
leave to goldberg and pizzetti , moss and mcgrindle . and goldberg in he pad : n.b . he almost pathological need to denigrate critic and criticism . the	image	of the critic as scape - goat in post - romantic art , wrote goldberg . keat . wordsworth at cambridge .
as in protevangelium ; and i look up into the pole of the heavens and see it stand still , and the fowl of the heavens without motion and of a sudden all thing move onward in they course . every	image	, of it nature , he wrote , freeze the world . for century we have try to pretend that this be not the case . we cannot , with the come of moving film , go on with this pretence .
move at good , but too often tricksy . how though to get sense of whole world pause , before move on impossible if you think of paint as	image	of piece of world . but if you think of it as model of whole world , as great cathedral be say to be , or physicist 's model today marcus , wrote harsnet ( type goldberg ) .
the choice be to ignore this or to draw attention to it . i cannot ignore it . so i have choose to make an	image	of the failure of cause to relate to effect . delay in glass be delay in life , he wrote . fatal delay , he wrote .
exactly the same battleline , with exactly the same watchword and against much the same enemy , now urgently need to be draw up to save the traditional british pub . an old - fashion , romanticise image of the pub be common fodder for we national nostalgia industry . cosy	image	of thatch country inn abound on glossy book cover . christma card , chocolate box and tourist literature , proclaim a timeless tradition that be suppose to be the envy of the world . too often , though , myth and reality part company outside the door , behind the rose and the last flaile morris dancer .
director roger pomphrey 's documentary crew film ub40 at home in brum and follow they down to london with they family and friend . once at finsbury park , the camera catch they at the sound check , in interviews , backstage , and relax before the gig . unite music and	image	, this unusual concert film provide insight into the stage of the event , the comments of the fan and the band . featur many of they great hit , the film capture the brummie band at they good , before an audience of around 35 , 000 eager fan . brian traver associates be proud to show the world premiere of this new film in ub40 's home town at the birmingham film and television festival .
it should not be despise , bombay talky , any much than mizoguchi despise the melodrama he take from the kabuki theatre . on the contrary , it offer great possibility . here too , ghatak make use of jung in he think about popular culture , look for way of use psychoanalytic concept , unconscious motif and	image	, in order to affect the audience at a deeper , less conscious level than many committed film . at the same time , ghatak believe in experiment , in the need for an experimental cinema . he be interested in the work of norman maclaren , the surrealist , godard .
in extreme cas anthropologist have find such a role impossible to live with , for the field situation be beyond they previous imaginations . castenada ( 1970 ) , for example , find he be deal with new event and totally new way of understand . as a result , he necessarily develop a new self -	image	, and take on a new social personality in the process . in castenada 's case , he enter a world so different that he come to accept reality it as nothing but a social construct , with effect so devastat that ethnography become mysticism ( goward 1984 : 90 ) . for jeanne favret - saada ( 1980 ) , who set out to study witchcraft in the french bocage , the only means of move in on the discourse she hope to understand be to become part of it .
just as the white - coate doctor in hospital symbolize the clean and purify nature of the healer , so the dark uniform of the police symbolize not just the force identity , but also the presence of the avenger , who purify through retribution rather than by cure . it be the marker of force and hence continue to sustain the continuing paradox of police force police service which remain unresolve , on which i will say very late in relation to the role of woman police officer . the dark uniform we wear have a military cap with polish brim , and in we fashioned tunics of soft serge and shiny boot we present an avenge	image	, cloth in the symbolic colour of death and darkness . black be a light absorbent , non - reflective colour and much suitable for controller who operate with a degree of social anonymity , uphold the rule of law and the abstraction of the legal system . in such a world , individuality be never a prize characteristic , and an attempt in the early 1980 to remove the one remain individualizing feature the shoulder numeral or collar number be correct reject by civilian as a structural move towards an even great anonymity .
in such a world , individuality be never a prize characteristic , and an attempt in the early 1980 to remove the one remain individualizing feature the shoulder numeral or collar number be correct reject by civilian as a structural move towards an even great anonymity . as reiner ( 1980 ) suggest , the riot gear in which the police be increase see , with shield , visore helmet , knee - length boot , and flame - proof overall , enhance they avenge appearance . i suspect it be no accident the politics of the time seem to parallel the grow toughness of the police	image	, or that the police have take on an increase resemblance to the black - clothed enemy of goodness who sprinkle the popular science fantasy film such as star war , superman , and the like . in this mass cultural replay of the eternal dichotomy between good and evil , the use of high symbolic black uniforms as an indicator of anonymous evil predominate . within the separate police force , the nuance of uniform difference be always embroider by real polise to produce symbolic boundary from which to assess other uniform wearer .
it always come out different anyway . ok , say marina , this be i version of psychoanalysis . self -	image	and so on . come on , boy and girl , drink up . they move into a circle .
look at a particular point on the wall in front of you and try to relax . breathe slowly and rhythmically , press the tip of you tongue against the back of you upper front tooth . select a relax	image	, such as a sparkle brook or a littrestle ocean . try to hear the sound of the water , feel it wetness against you skin and visualise it littrestle movement . if you econcentrat hard enough , you mental activity will slow down .
but sure it be right to warn the people , to make they feel they plight . it be a time for fierce tactics , not for scruple . but the scruple would spaw in he head , give a cynical taint to he	image	of he . he sigh tired , as though he have be work for a full day with stone and timber , and try to listen to james menzy , who be well away , drink whisky with allan and simmer with the news from the west , where the list have be tear down from the church door at fortingall and kenmore , and from blair atholl : the duke 's factor have have to meet a crowd of much than a thousand and the duke have sign a paper swear not to impose the act . james seem in a fever .
the fewer also to provide food . how to balance out this factor they eye follow thy bird as it	image	shrink and lose it in space . all around they the shoulder of the hill be brown by the fading of the heather , dul by the weaken sunshine , they expans turn dusty - blank as though a great grinding have sift down on they , decade of labour and hardship , and leave they blind . a desert , menzy think , a wilderness where you might just manage to survive for forty day and forty night , especially if there be an angel at hand to minister to you .
no good to say that strathtay be not ready for they . if they have say this about the paris workman , louis would still be on the throne through all the turnings of he thought one	image	dog he colberg 's face , so sharply car , he eye a wee bit slant at the corner , he nostril cut on a long shallow curve , he forehead not round but angle above the glossy black hair at the outside end of he eyebrow . a professional cavalier , who enjoy excell at the game of soldier , who give he order with the perfect authority of a corp who drill have be temper by a score of successful war , a hundred victory , a million unsung deaths . they prepare cameron for he appearance in the high court of justiciary by one final interview , a dry recapitulation of what have be say before , with the slightest of hint that it would go well for he if he divulge something about the unite scotsmen , who evidently still prey on they mind .
leonard cohen be a man of medium height , five - foot , eight - inch ( 173 cm ) ; lean , with a rug , world - weary face . he look like a man who should be heavy than he be , and one soon realise that an iron discipline keep it that way . he enjoy he food and wine , but disallow it enjoyment to distort the	image	which be important chiefly to he , and then to he public . he be frequently describe as have the stoop of an age crop - picker and the face of a curious little boy which may have be true 30 year ago , but now belong to the discard - tray with other caricature : caricature , as oscar wilde observe , be compliment that mediocrity pay to genius . grey a little at the temple , leonard unconsciously confirm why he be labell one of canada 's sexi man , a handsome and elegant man with dark eye ( they be say to be green , but that never show in the light of montreal , nor in it wintry sunshine ) .
from now on he be an enthusiastic convert ; a propagandist , indeed . word as discovery poetry be	image	wrapp up in rhythm . sir stephen spender the poem be the place where occasion be exhausted , where opportunity be use up .
omitt he radical change of direction ( i.e . of subject ) in he second year , it represent a demand of surrealist proportion , especially when one consider that alongside this he be read french , latin , mathematics , philosophy and history . he task , one of unend and heady excitement , be now well and truly under way ! little wonder that he sometimes give the impression of inattentiveness in class ; he be inebriate in a world of letter , engulf by an avalanche of idea and	image	, form and metre , essay and critique : a fast - change , provocative kaleidoscope which take he already well - stock and fertile mind to fresh height . paradise it be not ; but at little it resemble something like it antechamber . he plunge he into all this and very , avid read everything that come he way ; especially poetry , and not little spanish , chinese and japanese poet in translation , but chiefly that of federico garia lorca and w.b . yeat , of who he muse , i love yeat ; he connection ( such an important code - word with leonard ! ) he rhythm .
layton descri the four thing which stand out in leonard , which give he the confidence to work as he do , and promote he work : the strong tradition of learn ; the business entrepreneurship of he family ; the broad philanthropy/charity which hall - mark it ; and , lastly , the self - awareness that come from be a cohen not understand as class - distinction , but from the high symbolism of the priest and he role . this latter be particularly interesting . it be raise by dudek in somewhat different form when he say that leonard always have an	image	of he as a rabbi . we be talk of two very perceptive man who mty be perception ; and they recollection of leonard at this young age , he late teenage year . layton put it somewhat differently when he add that the two great quality a young write have be he arrogance and inexperience , and on another occasion he pick out the twin characteristics of precocity and independence .
he , like he uncle , be a cohen , with a rank and a call . but , for all they excellence , he do not like , he could not agree with , what he see . he self -	image	and he idealism be be threaten at the anvil of reality . he continue : no , he uncle be not grave enough .
for she intelligence , beauty and charm he have the high admiration ; it evoke a poem party at hydra : for marianne . she be the sort of woman to evoke poem , from leonard not little , and lastingly . the spice - box be delectable in it fragrance , chagallian in it rich mixture of	image	and response . as leonard express it in the poem which in title and texture counterbalance the title of the book : out of the land of heaven down come the warm sabbath sun .
as i shall explain in the next section , this earlier privilege of intellect be intimately connect with resistance to nominalism , and , in the seventeen century nominalism triumph . the emphasis on the mentality and immateriality of sense experience be associate with the denial that there be anything special about intellect . even whilst develop the modern immaterialist notion of consciousness , the eighteen - century empiricist and other be attack the dignity of intellect and assimilat it to sensory activity by treat thought as mere	image	. as well as be a defence of mind , therefore , the early modern philosophy , through it nominalism , be also an attack on it . and , in certain important respect , the general form of this attack be preserve in contemporary physicalist theory .
( see the discussion of this development elsewhere in this book , particularly chapter 4 and 7 . ) and it have lead to the introduction of new technology for the direct investigation of the relationship between brain , behaviour and external event , the subject of the present chapter . much current procedure for recorde the electrical activity of the brain , or produce radiographic	image	of the live human brain , or investigat the accuracy and time of behaviou be dependent on comput capacity which be not available twenty year ago . but many of the technique which computer be enabl we to exploit be not new . by 1875 , the liverpool physiologist richard caton have detect tiny fluctuation in voltage present on the surface of the brain or scalp of monkey , cat and rabbit .
so again , laboratory technique be afford scientist a glimpse of they subject 's mental life . the brain be not only an electrical machine , it also have a physical and chemical structure and this too be now be monitore in the live brain . by use computer to integrate the information from a large number of different viewpoint round the skull , it be possible to visualize the appearance of a slice through the brain and build up a full three - dimensional	image	. the view medium can be x - ray , as in computerize tomographic ( ct ) scan ; magnetic resonance of atomic nuclei , as in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) scan ; or emission from radioactive labell substance incorporate into the structure of nerve cell as in positron emission tomographic ( pet ) scan . this obviously have considerable clinical value for localize and identify area of brain abnormality , but they also enable area of activity in the normal function brain to be picture .
the view medium can be x - ray , as in computerize tomographic ( ct ) scan ; magnetic resonance of atomic nuclei , as in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) scan ; or emission from radioactive labell substance incorporate into the structure of nerve cell as in positron emission tomographic ( pet ) scan . this obviously have considerable clinical value for localize and identify area of brain abnormality , but they also enable area of activity in the normal function brain to be picture . the resolution of this picture be still relatively coarse and they produce only a stationary	image	at a single moment in time . nevertheless , they have demonstrate activity in the visual area during an image task , in the language area during a verbal task and even , on one - occasion , in the high visual area of a schizophrenic patient who subsequently report that he have be hallucinat . remarkable as this observation be , they be currently only confirm what be know already about localization within the brain .
she lie on she bed for hour lead righteous riot of millhand against languid tophatted fop or hardface bowlerhatted man of iron and steel . harriet , she regret soft , i have no answer for you . harriet , you cornfield be the spit	image	of the one at home . she remember the way the sun would sink down as the combine slice out the last rank of the wheat . rabbit would dash out of they lose darkness , and the village boy would chase they with stick and yell , careful not to get in front of the two who have the gun .
she feel imperialize , that everything familiar to she be be disturb , the peace be be disturb , and that we way of tell ( form ) and what we have to tell ( contend ) be simply not something that should be on an agenda of any kind . which be intereste because here the three of we be , think about what it mean to belong somewhere , what it might mean to belong to this idea call theatre . and we be discover that we be not interested in explor the fi point of alienation with tea cuppery , but that the theatre can be a bridge of bone between sickness and health that we language will somehow always be on the edge of poetry and that	image	and metaphor be we natural tool they good express whole world and history in collision with each other . why do not you just talk straight - madam mosely sucks a mint with vigour . when the kurd talk to he mother in teheran from the telephone in the common room , he can hear bullet be shoot just outside she front door , and we hear he tell she to take the phone away from the window .
when it be time for they to go , she roll up the carpet full of soil and put it in she bedroom . late on she teach she grand - daughter how to sew , how to make tripe , and she teach she politics . annie , now in she thirtie , talk about what be work class means in term of self -	image	and wor . of how there be no accurate contemporary representation of she life , only this heritage stuff about happy agricultural labourer with straw in they mouth , or chirpy cockney eat winkle . she say she need to gather up , in she post - modern skirt , all the creative , affirmative , intellectual part of she childhood ; she need to know how she folk survive , and when she look for they in england , on tv , at the theatre , in art gallery , in advertise , they be invisible .
when question about the contradiction between he enormous lecture fee and he suppose inter in the disenfranchised , avele reply , well , it be english you know , quite english . when eleanor leave , the statue of liberty have just be unveil in new york harbour . icon for future paperweight , imitation foam tiara , and torch cover with foam flame , an	image	to be print on bumper sticker , t - shirts and sweatpant , some of which , through donation , will find they pass out by evangelical missionary in central america one hundred year after the unveiling . but in 1886 , when eleanor marx sail back to england , the statue be a symbol in it infancy , a giant thing , a gift from france , construct in part and ship across the atlantic . if you walk litte from the telephone bar and grill , you arrive at the block where eleanor marx stay when she come to new york .
what price the future by john parson ( daily telegraph ) seldo have philippe chatrier , a man renown for he forthright view , especially whenever he have feel the advancement or the	image	of tennis be at risk , be quite so outspoken blunt , as in he final presidential newsletter he issue before ende he 14 year reign in charge ( which refer to in last month 's column ) at the international tennis federation . the focus of what could be see as a heartfelt cry for commercial sanity to be restore to the sport centr upon one simple but now all - consume issue money ! make no mistake , he warn , money be now a cancer in the game .
i grandfather have always take a keen interest in i work , and i have an equal admiration of the storie of he time spend in burma during the second world war . therefore it seem fit that as a tribute to he and he comrade i produce a sculpture with this tool . the strongest	image	i get from he storie and subsequent research be of the oppressive jungle and heat in which the soldier fight . they give the colloquial name of chindit . particular unit who operate for long period at a time in the jungle become so adeep in they surrounding they become know as green ghost .
markete too underwent a revolution ; old name the tournament at paddington , the golden frame at sheffield be out , while in come the snappy new quicksnack or station tavern that proudly proclaim a new image nationwide . everywhere , too , customer be find much nicer thing to eat . sandwich nearly 7 million sold on station in 1985 lose they curly	image	; the new order be tuna cucumber , salami coleslaw , or blt bacon , lettuce and tomato . the immediate success of this filling , and the brown bread they come in , reflect john bull 's broaden palate . as the 1980 progress , season traveller observe that the offering of railway station , airport and motorway service area be grow very and very alike .
an even very excit development be trailertrain , comprise a special profiled road trailer which could be loade on to railway bogy , again without the need for fixe equipment at the transfer location . final , one of the good keep secret of the decade until it unveil in 1988 be the redland self - discharge aggregate train , a permanent coupled set of hopper wagon with a conveyor belt run underneath and a special unload vehicle at one end . railfreight petroleum 's new	image	. refurbish class 37/7 no 37888 petrolea pass stratford with the 09.22 micheldeverripple lane empty tank train on 3 november 1988 . the highcapacity wagon would be work to one of the refinery at thames haven .
all brewer use the female hop but lager brewer want seedless one while ale producer need fertilise variety with they much robust and earthy bitterness . english hop be now busily develope the export trade and be help grower to produce seedless variety which mean wage war on the hapless and horny male hop . you have get to get rid of the male , david gardner say with such fierce determination that he conjure up an	image	of concentration camps for male hops in remote part of kent . it be no good one neighbour try to grow seedless if next door he neighbour have see hops blow poll over the fence . but before you rush to form the male hop liberation front , the little devil be still much in demand .
some shot , particularly the front and rear cover of the book , be quite stunn . but other be less impressive and i wonder how and why they make it through to the final selection . the chapter on annapurna contain several	image	which i feel be well below the overall standard . perhaps they have lose something in the print , but the reader will never know . if you be look for a picture book on nepal for a present or a memento of a trip then this be certainly as good as , if not good than , many of it rival .
the various viewpoint and they approach walk be entertainingly descri in the author 's competent , easy to read style and contain anecdote , useful information about the legend , history and geology of the area along with other fascinating disclosure . the length of the outing vary from a gentle stroll to long mountain day , detail of which be show on map in the now familiar pen and ink style of mark richards . the inclusion of john cleare 's name on the book cover usually guarantee quality photograph , and the colour and atmospheric black and white	image	be no disappointment . let 's face it , it be usually good photograph that attract walker to a specific place and often convey far much than word can . after see the picture of scafell massif take in even sunshine from the summit of yewbarrow , i could not help wishing i will be there .
and recall kafka on incidental madness in dostoevsky ; it be not just the child who svidrigailov terrifies . ) raskolnikov be not with we either , but in the novel 's final text he could not have do or say any of the thing i have just mention . even he way of throw he money about , what he have of it , be immediately distinguishable from svidrigailov 's , while with both of they money be the very	image	of mere impute and therefore reversible value in a loose - end world : you to the right and i to the left , or the other way round if you like . cocoon in false - napoleonic narcissism he read about he own deed in the newspaper . he go in for a sort of hall - of - mirror self - impersonation , tell people how he would have do the murder if he have do it ( which he have ) .
she have do something , something on a different plane from make a toy church or pipp a social rival at the post or committ a mindless atrocity . she action be unquestionable deedy ; they bear no theoretical burden , unlike kirillov 's suicide ; they run deep while she be on the job than the paper person in she , and they make a rigid , final oppose of the profane midwife and the god - seek husband academic and quite inadequate to the novel . nor do it get we anywhere to learn from anna dostoevsky 's memoir that the story of the frantic shatov , where phras seem inevitable and	image	unsotch it do not help to be tell by the novelist 's widow that this flawless page lean heavily on he own behaviour while they first child be be bear . it be all a question of what a write can use , what the work in hand will let he use . for example , there be a minor character in the possessed , a quarrelsome eccentric lady , and she believe lake geneva give people toothache .
the team , lead by professor michael rowan - robinson of queen mary and westfield college , university of london , include astronomer from cambridge , oxford and durham universitie as well as qmw , and from caltech , pasadena and charlottesville , virginia . they discover the object with the uk 's 4.2m william herchel telescope ( wht ) on la palma in the canary on the last night of a 40 - night observe campaign , study very faint source detect by the iras infrar astronomical satellite with optical ground - base telescope . subsequently the team obtain	image	of this mysterious object with the 200in mt palomar telescope and the wht . it be slight fuzzy and presumable a distant galaxy . the spectrum be that of a very distant galaxy with redshift of 2.3 ( spectral line shift in wavelength towards the red by 230 % ) .
obviously there be a price to be pay in hold the liquid helium temperature . but the group be convince that it be only a matter of time before someone discover superconduct semiconductor that will work at the economically viable temperature of liquid nitrogen . optical	image	of ira f10214+4724 take with the mt palomar telescope . ellipse show the estimate location of the infrar source . f if the high redshift galaxy .
to save or transfer drawing make on cad system ; to save or transfer	image	from computer art system , scanner , or acquire from a camera ; to control advance printer ;
a high - level approach , sometimes refer to as a draw description or vector file , or meta file ; a low - level approach base upon the pixel information use to display a digital	image	file . draw description file the main application of this file be in cad .
this be exactly the kind of picture which we might want to save from a screen paintbrush job ; lovely blend of colour , subtle shade and shape , and not a straight line anywhere . image capture from tv , send back from space , or very prosaically produce by a document scanner , be likely to fall into the same category . for this type of picture the bit	image	file come into it own . the picture be write to file in term of pixel , individual spot of light or ink which , in suitable large number , create the picture . in some cas a bit image be little much than a memory dump of video ram .
for this type of picture the bit image file come into it own . the picture be write to file in term of pixel , individual spot of light or ink which , in suitable large number , create the picture . in some cas a bit	image	be little much than a memory dump of video ram . video rbe like many memory , be usually organise in 8 - bit wide word , or byte , but interpret in a bit orient manner . fig . 4 show the first few byte of video ram , with address run from the base address upwards .
this be illustrate in fig . 6 , show typical map from the start of the four bit plane base address and the first line of pixel on the screen . the main body of a bit image file consist of data byte with bit map similar to fig 3 to 5 . bit	image	file normal have a fix format header give general information about the file and it format . one way to handle different bit map scheme be to include in the header detail such as the number of bit plane , bit per pixel , pixel per scan line , and the number of scan line . this low level pixel orient approach obviously make sense for complex image with no formal structure , such as budgerigar .

since data compression rely on redundancy in the information to be compress , performance be affect by the nature of the data . there be various method which can be use for computer file ( see box get quart into pint pot ) . run length limitation ( rll ) be probably the much common for bit	image	file , although the lzw algorithm be also in use . in the future , compression use technique from digital tv , or base on fractal theory , could become important . another problem be compatibility .
in the future , compression use technique from digital tv , or base on fractal theory , could become important . another problem be compatibility . while a cad transfer file can describe object with the accuracy of float point number , a bit	image	file be restrict to a digitise process . far from be device neutral , the image file be usually code in a way which reflect the device which first produce it . how should it handle transfer between different resolution
another probley be compatibility . while a cad transfer file can describe object with the accuracy of float point number , a bit image file be restrict to a digitise process . far from be device neutral , the	image	file be usually code in a way which reflect the device which first produce it . how should it handle transfer between different resolution at first sight the obvious answer might be to convert all image to some enormously high resolution which would satisfy any possible requirement .
far from be device neutral , the image file be usually code in a way which reflect the device which first produce it . how should it handle transfer between different resolution at first sight the obvious answer might be to convert all	image	to some enormous high resolution which would satisfy any possible requirement . mature reflection say two second make this less attractive . however high you choose this super resolution , the day will come when it be not enough .
however high you choose this super resolution , the day will come when it be not enough . another point be that it would make much bit image file far long than necessary . the good scheme , by far , be to do what be normal do , ie . , write a bit	image	file in term of the resolution available at the time it be create . if you want to display it on a device with different resolution , you have the follow option :
if you want to display it on a device with different resolution , you have the follow option : if the new resolution be great than the original , you can show you entire	image	at it original resolution in part of you new display device , ie . , in a window of it . if you want to , you can expand it to fill the complete display by use a suitable expansion algorithm .
if the new resolution be little than the original , you can show part of the original at full resolution , and pan it around if appropriate , or compress it to make it all visible . in any case , keep the original bit	image	file . it represent all of the available picture information , and no surplus information . remember that any compress or expand version of a bit image will contain distortion of the original , however , intelligent the algorithm use .
in any case , keep the original bit image file . it represent all of the available picture information , and no surplus information . remember that any compress or expand version of a bit	image	will contain distortion of the original , however , intelligent the algorithm use . example of bit image file format be :
it represent all of the available picture information , and no surplus information . remember that any compress or expand version of a bit image will contain distortion of the original , however , intelligent the algorithm use . example of bit	image	file format be : paintbrush/frieze pcx format : paintbrush be a screen draw programme from zsoft , and frieze be a terminate - stay - resident utility which can be use by other application to capture a screen to a .
pcx file . i can find frieze invaluable for captur graphical output from number crunch software . the pcx format starts with a 128 byte header give various general detail , include bits/pixel , the number of bit plane , and the size of the	image	in pixel . this be follow by the binary pixel data , compress with bit orient run length limitation code ( see box ) .
bit image ( img ) format : this be use by the gem system . the head information include the physical size of each pixel , in micron , thus link the	image	firm to it original representation . the binary pixel information be compress by rll coding which can define repetition of a single bit value , or of a repeate bit pattern .
tag image file format ( tiff ) ( file extension . tif . ) this be develop by the aldus corporation and microsoft particularly for	image	obtain from scann device , and be widely use in desk top publishe . it be support by many scanner manufacturer , and can in some case be produce from fax . it be also support by a number of screen base graphics application .
it be support by many scanner manufacturer , and can in some case be produce from fax . it be also support by a number of screen base graphics application . the format have a tree like structure which provide very flexibility than many bit	image	file , and a powerful range of alternative compression method . other bit image format be gif , which use lzw compression and be widely use for clip art ; pic , which be use by the halo screen art programme ; and cut , which use the enhanced small disk drive rll compression algorithm . colou and dither
it be also support by a number of screen base graphics application . the format have a tree like structure which provide very flexibility than many bit image file , and a powerful range of alternative compression method . other bit	image	format be gif , which use lzw compression and be widely use for clip art ; pic , which be use by the halo screen art programme ; and cut , which use the enhanced small disk drive rll compression algorithm . colou and dither like video ram much graphics file support colour by , in effect , index into a look up table .
like video rbe much graphics file support colour by , in effect , index into a look up table . if a draw description file refer to colour 1 , the actual colour will be whatever colour 1 be set to . similarly , if a 16 colour bit	image	file format refer to re , green , blue and intensity plane , this will only be true of the default palette setting . however , it be quite common for graphics file to allow a colour table to be include , thus defi the palette . a 16 colour pcx file header , for example , include a 48 byte colour table .
a 16 colour pcx file header , for example , include a 48 byte colour table . each colour be define by 3 byte , one for each of the primary additive colour , red , green and blue . many printer be monochrome , but the often have a high resolution than bit	image	date . thus they can convert colou to a grey scale by a process call dither . although each printer pixel can normally be only black or white , a grey scale can be produce by vary the proportion of black to white dot .
they need to be . the modern printer be normal a bit - map device with a wide range of facility . before print a page , the printer 's processor assemble a complete bit map	image	into it memory . like other graphics , font can be descri in a high level manner , or as bit map image . that store in high level form be call outline or stroked font , and scale much very gracefully than bit image font , particularly to large size .

when wide bandwidth networke become available , the ability to move graphical information quickly around a network bring the cental multi user processor concept into the wimp era , and this have require clearly define standard for the graphical user interface ( gu i ) . one such standard be the x window system , develop by an industry collaboration group and the massachusett institute of technology . it be large base on the bit	image	approach , and assume a resolution of around 100 pixel per inch , which could become a limitation in the future . however , x be very widely support , and be associate with the unix operat system and the move to open standard in the it industry . a competitor to x be sun microsystem 's network extensible window system ( new ) which in some way be technicalsuperior .
eagleton 's althusserian phase of the mid - 1970 be strongly attack by a marxist academic , kiernan ryan , who have since take issue with another marxist , alan sinfield , on the extent to which the great literary works of the past can transcend the reactionary ideology that produce they . sinfield believe that they be often irredeemable taint by ideology , at good to be read only in historical term , or subject to symptomatic reading , seek the fracture and fissure in the mystify surface of the text that show the true ideological condition in which it be produce . against this , ryan advance the humanistic belief that the major canonical text be not inherently reactionary , and that they contain implicit	image	and model of human freedom which transcend they immediate historical context and which late reader can respond to . this be an interesting eclectic argument which recall gadamer on the fusion of horizon ( the reader 's and the text 's ) , marcuse on the utopian possibility of high culture , and sartre on the necessarily progressive implication of major literature . ryan represent a kind of marxism that non - marxist might do business with , in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it .
the real problem be that the writer of such text may make political difficulty within a department , or teach in way difficult for student to understand . again , english departments can be unhelpful about participat in scheme for train academics how to teach , claim that teach literature be less easy define and methodologize than teaching engineere or economic . at a time when a good public	image	be essential for university , english be unable to explain it in way immediately intelligible to the outsider , be notoriously riven with doubt and disagreement that prevent it from have a share sense of purpose , and may at interval erupt into crise that attract the wrong sort of publicity . it be time , it be think , for english to organize it in way that make it very like a proper academic discipline , with clear procedure and goal . the adjacent social science provide the model for a genuine professionalism and accountability .
it still seem to i that the act critics of poesy be for the much part incapable of look for much than one thing at a time , have get start about 1913 ( i mean a few of em get start about 1913 and a lot have start since ) to look for a certain plainness and directness of speech and simple order of word ; and have about 1918 got start look for mr eliot 's rather much fragile system ( a system excellent for mr eliot but not very much use to any one else ) , they now limit they criticism to inquire whether or no verse conform to one or other of this manner , thereby often omitt to notice fundamental , or quality as important as verbal directness and even very important than snap . the meaning of snap in relation to eliot 's rather very fragile system be at this date , i suppose , irrecoverable ; but the general drift of this remark be clear . and this be not the only place in the exile where pound show he restive inside the	image	of he that have be buil up among initiate by he propaganda of fifteen year before , when he have take over imagism and champion ford madox ford 's idea about a diction for poetry that should be plain and direct . at the end of this same issue of the exile there appear from pound a page heade desideria : quite simply : i want a new civilization .
it be not a lack of the amorous , perhaps , so much as it be a completely different sense of the amorous to that which post - christian man contain , to that which the like of duncan , say , or i may feel . of the like of bill w . i be strike by the	image	of fire in paterson . maybe fire be the opposite principle to light , and come to the use of that who do not go the way of light . fire have to consume to give off it light .
ezra provide i with a standard ; and gingere i into an attempt to train towards it . certainly it be the pound of the london year , who have profit from ford madox ford 's pronouncement on diction , that phyllis bottome must have have in mind when she wrote : the concrete	image	, unruffle by an adjective , be a thing ezra would willing have dy for . rhetoric be a thing he would gladly have murder ; and he have already carry out he theory of honest think at the expense of considerable financial and perhaps emotional sacrifice . he passionate and austere sincerity act like a torch upon the young intellectual of he day .
in fact the original eighteen poems of the hardy sequence , ( in the collect poems of 1919 , he damagingly extend it by three extra piece ) tell a story of the poet 's pilgrimage to he and emma 's early haunt , match the stage of the journey there and back to specific stage of aenea 's journey , in aeneid 6 , to the abode of the blest . it thus represent , on the part of the supposedly non - modernist hardy , a stratagem often take to be definitively modernist : the use of an ancient fable to structure and resonate with a twenty - century narrative , as the odyssey structure and resonate with james joyce 's ulysses . yet so firmly established be the	image	of hardy as a rustic provincial that virgil rate not a single entry in the index to j.o . bailey 's 700 - page poetry of thomas hardy , a handbook and commentary , ( university of north carolina , chapel hill , 1970 ) . hardy undoubted read virgil in the original ; yet we know that long before he teach he latin he remarkable mother give he ( on he eighth birthday ) a copy of dryden 's translation of the aeneid .
he mock of he opponent , lord home , serve not only to challenge the competence of the establishment but equally to advertise the superior competence of harold wilson . wilson say it all when he say after half a century of democratic advance , the whole process have ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl . he tag the tory with a grouse moor	image	and mock home for he matchbox economic . he use language , the politician 's only weapon , to build a momentum for change sufficient to carry labou to power on a modernise platform . here in brighton this week ream of revisionism be be pul through the decision - make process of the labour party conference , load of ideological lumber jettison as labou endeavwe to meet the challenge and make the change .
by the end of this week we shall know what the labour party no long stand for , such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and full - scale nationalisation ; but what , in essence , do it stand for if it do not exist , would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when , from the atlantic to the ural , socialism in all it manifestation be lose the argument to liberal capitalism for we should not become too carry away by labour 's change face and tone of voice , nor too dazzle by the peter mandelson	image	- conjur . the party may have put on a collar and tie but it be still the labour party , prone to it old reflex ( as it remind we yesterday on defence spend ) , prisoner still of it anachronistic structure , it mind set in 100 year of work - class history . listen to the first day 's proceeding , i find i not transport into the future so much as revisite the past .
the report say mr zappala 's experience along with he civic activity make he an ideal candidate for the us embassy . spaniards and many diplomat may think otherwise . gentl salute president fw de klerk 's government be very keen to present a modern progressive	image	, to dispel any nagge doubt the rest of the world may harbou about what a deep repulsive ideology aparthey really be . in line with this cosmetic policy , out go the sjambok , the rhino - hide whip use by police . as another step in this direction , the south african ari be to down it salute from the exist bellicose method of raise the entire arm above the shoulder .

unuse to internal democracy , party member continue to vote as they leadership obviously wish they to vote . the plenum agree a date for the 11th party congress , on 27 january , and call for election for congress delegate under new democratic rule . the congress , which will be attend by up to 2 , 000 delegate , be intended to re - make the party in a european	image	, as party spokesman jan bisztyga have say . leave behind they stalinist - era organisation and programme , poland 's communist want to become a left - w parliamentary party capable of winn election . if we remain in unity for three month then we will win the battle , say mr bisztyga at a briefing before yesterday 's central committee plenum .
there be also uncertainty among expert as to whether it belong to picasso 's blue or pink period . it be now reveal to be blue period but one of the last painting of this series . it already use the harlequin	image	which be characteristic of the pink period painting . the harlequin be enamoure of a young dancer who have be force to marry the proprietor of the troupe . she sit at the marriage banquet , apparently in a cafe , and the harlequin have just present she with a bouquet .
that so - call soft subject like health be now valid area of inquiry and sport merit good and much detailed coverage have now be realise . the colour - print facility , initially to be use only for advertise , may be use to produce a weekend leisure colou supplement early next year . i do not believe in the fatal decline of the write word , say mr fontaine , but we be compet all the time not so much against television , because the screen	image	and the print word complement each other , as against magazine , and against the time people spend get to work and then they leisure time against music and the cinema . not all the le monde journalist support the change , which be the result of two year 's market research and several dummy editions . a professional designer , jean bayle , with a track record for breathe new life into tired title , be hire but the change he favoure be deem rather too radical and , in the end as be often the case on le monde where the staff hold a significant stake in the company the consensus view prevail .
race : haine take rein for sweet surgery by john karter , race correspondent the much - malign man of the jockey club have find a sugar daddy to boose they	image	with a little cosmetic surgery . that have be the typically cynical reaction to the appointment of christopher haine , a high - flyer from the sugar industry , as the club 's first ever chief executive . constructive criticism be a healthy thing , particularly where a self - elect body like the jockey club be concern .
introduce wired , he biography of john belushi , bob woodward recall how the rigour of research involve go to b early so as to rise at 4be to visit one of the comedian 's favourite water hole . annotated , log and index , he book scarcely illuminate belushi 's demon , or the system that supposed destroy he . but it do summon up the delicious	image	of the straitlaced reporter gingerly dip he toe , notebook in hand , into the showbiz underworld . the film of wired ( 18 ) feature woodward ( j t walsh ) as straight man to the podgy comedian , but though subtitle the laugh and time of john belushi , it be woefully short on the former component . while the book chart he passage through chicago , new york and final los angele , it large skip the first two circle of hell .
as the part require an actor of substantial proportion , the obvious choice would be someone like john candy or john goodman ( of david byrne 's true story and channel four 's roseanne ) though he may be simply too nice to play ignatius , and be anyway busy perfect he bowling technique for he upcom appearance as fred in the live - action version of the flintstone . from a slight much elevate plane of cinematic endeavour come news to warm the heart of woody allen . ingmar bergman , who for some year now have be insistent that fanny and alexander be he farewell to the moving	image	, have decide to stage a come - back with a project call the good will . set in uppsala at the begin of the century , it tell the story of bergman 's parent , and will be make for two different format : as a four - part series for televsion , and as two feature film for cinema . unfortunately , bergman have decide not to direct he own script , but have instead put it in the hand of the danish director bille august , who make pelle the conquerer , which win last year 's palme d ' or at canne and which bergman be rumoure to like so much that he have already see it six time .
mr bush have be have trouble with he speed , no doubt about it . after nine month in office he still be uncertain whether to go fast or slow on any issue from the russian to oil slick . the result be a presidency with an	image	of blandness much different from the glitzy campaign mr bush wag to win the white house from michael dukakis who , it be worth remark , be governor of the speedy state of massachusett . but it could be that president bush be aware of this , and it could be that thing be about to change because of the return to washington this week of one sig rogich . this untypically flashy icelander , who have live much of he life in las vega , and work on mr bush 's election campaign , have recently be in charge of polish the image of frank sinatra and donald trump , the new york city real estate person .

they cannot imagine he as a prime minister , and they cannot imagine that the british public can be persuade to elect he to that post . they forget that many people once feel that way about margaret thatcher . conservative be foolish lull they with they own rhetoric if they think that the reformed labour party be an	image	- maker 's fantasy . the change will not endure another election defeat ; if labour lose next time the party will probably tear apart . but it will survive right up to poll day and , if labour win , far beyond .
we have sow the seed , but we have fail to reap the harvest . if we be go to win , and win again , we must be as vigorous in promot we cause as the labour party . simon lee , of stratford - upon - avon , say that although the party machine be get a little bit tired , every member should accept they share of the blame for recent dent to the party	image	. but dozen of representative shout yes when he recall the european election campaign and ask they : can any of we say in all honesty that we do everything we could much of the blame for they slide in popularity could be attribute to cabinet minister argue over they official residence , and backbench tory mp take an independent line to far they own political career .
mr heseltine obviously have that potential . in both camps , there be agreement that an order succession with the conservative far well would tend to favour mr baker . a narrow election victory , or a defeat , could spur a change of	image	and direction to the advantage of mr heseltine . some baker supporter , and that back john major , to k and michael portillo , a long - term , right - w long shot , dismiss mr heseltine 's claim with equal vigour . time and again , he resignation during the westland affair be hold against he .

mr kinnock exploit political and city tensions over sterle yesterday with a call for the government to enter immediate negotiation to become a full member of the european monetary system . john smith , labou be treasury spokesman , be to tour a number of european capital next week to hammer out the party 's term of entry . but the gap in mrs thatch 's address reflect she own stand instruction to cabinet colleague : to calm down the government 's confrontational	image	. that message , and yesterday 's speech , contrast sharply with previous conference speech in which the prime minister insist that there could be no let - up in the long thatcherite march . nevertheless , she do give outright support to the stand take by the chancellor of the exchequer .
it be story like this which help to protect easton 's policeman and woman from the loss of morale which mann claim be an inevitable result of the contradiction between the image the police have of they and they work and the low - key nature of practical policing ( mann 1977 : 349 ; also see holdaway 1983 , 1988 , who make a similar point ) . the conceptualization of police work that be find in easton not only fit what be know of police force elsewhere , they parallel the portrayal of policing in the wide culture . the	image	of policing glean from police programme on british and american television and in film be very much how easton 's police see they , as other have comment with respect to police force elsewhere ( holdaway 1983 : 147 ; hurd 1979 ; klockar 1983 ; morris and heal 1981 ; tuska 1979 ) . the popularity of this programme among the section police in easton be both cause and effect of the evaluation they make of they work . the excitement , suspense , and danger which seem the lot of the police on celluloid feed into the definition many of easton 's section police give to they work experience , and the supposed similarity of this experience lead they to see police film and television programme as an accurate portrayal , to be watch avid because of this share world .
that policeman who have racist view be face with problem when the hero on celluloid be black , but when discuss such an instance , one policeman express he dislike for black but still find the film brilliant ( fn 9/10/87 , p 57 ) . very importantly , this imagery affect the demeanour of this macho man when deal with the public . sensitivity to public relation be not a quality which accompany the rambo self -	image	, and sergeant sometimes avoid place the policeman who live out this imagery in situations where they insensitivity can damage public perception of the police . various study have show that the public evaluate the police in term of the attitude the police show they when they be victim in need of police help ( for example , jone 1983 ; maguire 1982 ; shapland 1982 ; southgate and ekblom 1984 ) . it be not always possible for low - rank soffice to anticipate the situation which action men need to avoid , and some instance be observe where the aggressive manner of the policeman act as a form of amplification of deviance ( yoing 1971 ) , transform a minor situation into big crime .
move on loiter youths be a police situation ripe for such amplification , as other research have show ( southgate and ekblom 1986 : 35 , 37 ; yoing 1971 ) , and there be several occasion when policeman for who this imagery be very important over - react to the presence of young people on street corner and be aggressive in the way they move they on . on one occasion the aggression be return , result in the person be bring into the station and charge . of course , there be other situations when the toughness that accompany the rambo self -	image	be useful in disarm trouble - maker and prevent further crime , as happen very than once during field - work . the view of senior management be that policeman need to combine the qualitie of compassion and toughness and know when each be appropri ate ( fn 11/11/87 , pp . 78 ) , although in practice it be difficult to strike this fine balance . where it be see by work colleague to be get out of kilter , informal control can be use to restore equilibrium .
once again the weight of television coverage have no effect on party credibility ( though the nature of the coverage may have do so ) . public perception of party unity increase between we pre - campaign wave and the start of the final campaign . during the pre - campaign week we recorde no item on television news which positive project the	image	of party unity . this rather artificial news item be very much the product of the final election campaign . in public perception the gap between conservative unity and labour unity narrow sharply in the first few day of the campaign and again at the end , but actual increase very slight in the third week .

he concentrate on it because he love it , and he thereby prove once very he extreme simplicity of character . for he have reveal one of the eternally popular effect of nature , one which be still quoted by simple people as a standard of visual beauty . animal make up a category of paint with an uneven reputation , though the theme be one of obvious importance and	inter	in sculpture . animal painting in britain be the title of a book by basil taylor , where he explain in he first chapter that the topic have be neglect since it be either assume to be about sport picture , or about picture of horse by such specialist as sartorius . he quote the dismissive comment of the write of the volume on british painting 15301790 in the pelican history of art : to discuss the sartorius tribe and such painter be no business of the historian of art , no matter how bitter the accusation of neglect be wont to be from that specialist writer who sometimes confuse the history of art with praise famous horse .
the hudson memorial be not widely know , but the scope of this monograph be exemplary . similar treatment can be find in work on great monument and scheme , perhaps especially in the italian renaissance , when such project as the sistine chapel or tintoretto 's scuola di san rocco achieve a personal artistic unity of the high standard . for art historian , incomplete scheme or dismember works such as altarpiece have the attraction of need detective work ; but a critic take an	inter	in a reconstruction only if it throw new light on survive art . the main strength of this sort of monograph be it potential for detailed interpretation . as a book on a single subject , there be a good chance that the need for description will be reduce by extensive illustration , while a favourable judgement on the work have already be imply by the choice of the subject for a monograph .
the collaboration of artist with the stage be also bring to a high point by serge diaghilev , in he commissions to artist for the russian ballet . this connection between paint and the theatre be important to earlier european art in religious as well as secular performance . critic no less than artist have wide	interest	in the art , and may introduce comparison in they interpretation . in the nineteen century to say that a picture be poetic be a common term of praise . in the present century emphasis on formal qualitie in the visual art have make musical comparison very frequent , emphasise by the use by artist of musical terminology , as when kandinsky choose to call he work improvisation and composition .
you see an eye . this intention differ from the sculptor 's frequent artistic aim to make he small figure appear remote . the catalogue have the additional	inter	of a memoir by silvio berthoud , who have sit as a boy between five and eight for he uncle : i have very unpleasant recollection of sit for he , for it be of utmost importance not to move but to fix he right in the eye and listen to he complain , say as he always do that he be get nowhere . it be not much fun , particularly at i age
carritt buy it , correct identify it as a lost early work , and magnanimously sell it to the national gallery , london , far below the market price . auction catalogue do not carry critical comments on individual item for sale , but there be sometimes introduction with criticism . an example be the catalogue of painting by nol coward , which be preface by a memoir of the playwright , describe he	inter	in paint . in markete a sale of rather little - know works , too , there may be some explanatory text . it would be wrong to dismiss this sort of criticism as mere sale talk , particularly in grand auctioneer 's catalogue , though there be little danger of such publication be reticent .
a profile of the artist be another form in which to review an exhibition . when such an article rise above the level of a gossip column , the artist 's profile can be a valuable format . one source of	inter	can be a description of where the interview have take place , perhaps a studio , or maybe the artist 's home . after the second world war , for example , the photographer alexander liberman decide to visit the studio of artist who have contribute to a century of paint in france , painter and sculptor closely connect with the school of paris . he comment on he project : the much i explore , the much i become absorb with the mystery of the environment .
this distinguish alliance of landscape artist sotch to invigorate they country 's artistic life by bold treatment of wild canadian subject . tom taylor , mentor and leader , have die before the group have it first exhibition , but remain classe with he friend . they subsequently develop individual style and separate	interest	, as be true of many group of artist , but they initial appearance be define by a programme . another sort of title for a group be exemplify by der blaue reiter ( the blue rider ) . forty - three work by fourteen painter be show in 1911 at the first exhibition by the editorial board of the blue rider , the publication concern be an almanac which appear in 1912 with a drawing of a horseman by kandinsky on the cover .
first of all , outside the city , next to a growth of forest , there be thrushcross grange . name after the mansion in wuther height , this be a desolate agricultural commune run by jimmy ahmed , back from london , where he have be in some vague way a celebrity . he have extract land and money from business	interest	, but he revolutionary experiment have founder from the start . nathaniel hawthorne speak of the phantasmagorical antics he have play in describe the socialist community which appear in the blithedale romance : the antics play in the commune conceive by ahmed could also be call phantasmagorical . a nut - brown man by south kensington standard , he be light - skin in the west indy : he be a chinese negro , who think of he as a hakwai chinee hakwai , he explain , be chinese for nigger and who have not fail to notice that emily bront 's heathcliff be rumoure to be the emperor of china .
a sense of mystery and futility be impart by event at the grange and on the ridge , and that sense be heighten by what take place in the city when the party catch fire and rio break out . politician rush to the airport with they loot . then american military helicopter drift about the sky : a show of strength which be mean to secure american	interest	on the island , to make it safe for the bauxite investment . ahmed do not lead this revolution . no one do .
such people be impartial , up in the cloud , like good god . the man in the bush be watch by god who be barely a jump above they head : this white god be very remote . salim read about they doings in he magazine of popular science , and let ferdinand into the secret of he	inter	, he feel he be reveal he true self . but if he true nature be to be romantically on the rise , and to have idea , it be also he nature to occupy the middle ground . it be not lose on he that he read matter popular science , pornography be junk .
this aim have a sweepingness and a suspendingness which be apparent , too , in the novel to which it relate . many poems contain a critique of poetry , just as many contain a critique of the self - portray poet , and of he intention to serve a social or doctrinal system , or of he claim to be a special case . the lyric be not generically debar from stand out against the state , or from take a generous	inter	in what go on in the world . mandelstam be lyric about the kremlin mountaineer klima 's great generalissimo , stalin send he to the camp . ivan klima could be call a lyric author , and the notion of what it be to be such an author be examine in i first lof , who gentle and deliberate story read as if they have be grow and store before be make public .
in the open story miribe distribute milk to the tenement building and favour the boy with an extra help : but he never get to tell she that he be the lyric author of poem about love . about suicide . the second story be set in and around a country hotel , where the wife of a coarse doctor take a much than kindly	inter	in a klima wide - awake to the sight and sound of this paradise . the story end at a funeral , hover over by a surreal balloon , from which hang a fancy female acrobat . the boy 's hand be squeeze by the weep wife .
roth have leave off with he mythologise fury and he memoir let we know that the benefit that come to the write who try , or even seem , to stick to the fact may amount to something much than that of hindsight . it inform we of the force which shape roth 's tour de force of the sixty and early seventy , and it inform we of how he come to be where he be now . he have travell from the liberate past , when imagination take pow , to the liberation of an	inter	in fact a state which may or may not prive to have be , for roth , partial or provisional , and which the facts , in it totality , manage to enclose in an ironised uncertainty . he can look here at time a little like a man who have take the first step in a descent from the high ground of self - consciousness , impersonality , fantastication and ironic indirection not that this have late be , or have ever be , literature 's only ground . but perhaps it will come to be think by he reader that this successive attitude to the autobiographical , and to plain speak , in art be equally valid , equally reversible .
the friend feel levi have survive so that i could bear witness . levi go on to insist that the real witness be that who dy in the camp , and that that prisoner who do not be mostly compromised people or privileged people : solzhenitsyn be cit as make the same point about the pridurki the prominent of the gulag system . the book be no sequel to if this be a man , but it explication be never without	inter	. in the lage , cold and influenza be unknown , but one die , at time sudden , from illnesses that the doctor never have an opportunity to study . gastric ulcer and mental illness be heale ( or become asymptomatic ) but everyone suffer from an unceasing discomfort that pollute sleep and be nameless .
he work as a teach do not involve much in the way of teach . homework be a thing of the past . he classes be soliloquy and socratic tease in which he	inter	in classical antiquity , in pythagora and heraclitus , and in hlderlin , hegel and marx , and in james hogg , be impart to the young one . he be the sort of sixty dominie who use to inveigh in class against the system . he relationship with the kid be one between equals , but they also seem to expect he to be a wise man , and this be what he sometimes expect of he .
( monday to friday ) , give a taste of the kind of stamina that will ultimately be require over a much long period . ( at drama school the full - time course will frequently require the student to work until 9 p.m . and late when production be be mount . ) because summer school generate enormous	inter	oversea , there be nearly always a strong emphasis on the classical theatre , usually on shakespeare , and there will quite probably be class on classical text and mini - production exercise arise from this . you may find you do quite a bit of line learn . the daily schedule can be somethe like this :
the much important thing be you firm knowledge that the selection be within you present range . it be not much use arrive somewhere at ten in the morning clutch the collect work under you arm and wish you have a wig and be born thirty year earlier in order to play lear or for that matter the duke of gloucester . major role for old woman be not so common in shakespeare , but i think it be good not to choose a character such as queen katherine from henry viii , who need a richness of seniority to convey the dramatic	inter	. if you do want to portray an old figure , it would be preferable to try hermione in the winter 's tale she be a much fantastical character , without the added complication of historical authenticity , and so allow for great flexibility of characterisation . she trial scene ( act 3 , scene 2 ) which begin
the actor be dependent on the stimulus of other face and voice . quite a number of new actor form small fringe group and work in play on a profit share basis and work opportunity may grow from such scheme . small , little - know group do not general muster a large audience , of course , but they be often a good way of command	inter	from future employer . certainly the new actor should never remain idle but create chance wherever possible . this may sound like cold comfort when you be desperately hope for something to come along and get you go but continue you work and maintain skills be vitally important .
in particular the protestant bloc lose the southern protestant landown gentry . the two alliance be ascrib territory in which to produce they social structure , political institution , coercive body , informal and interpersonal network of maintain influence , and very clearly define hegemonic culture . the two society give expression to they own dominant	interest	as far as possible unhinder by each other 's interference . the process be assist in the north by the self - exclusion of britain from internal ulster affair by set up the stormont parliament which survive from 1922 to 1972 . protestant loyalist domination , successor to the ascendancy , be circumscri to one corner of ireland while the catholic nationalist alliance assert total domination in the remainder .
while the party contain many who active seek peace and reconciliation , it would be wrong to think of they in any sense as overcom the basic conflictual component of bloc power in ireland . castle catholic , that who find a place in the stormont administration and develop a stake in the union , have also vote alliance , but be probably now , in 1989 , switch they allegiance to the newly find conservative associations , which be seek to bring british party loyalty to ulster . the northern ireland statelet be founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalist of ulster and british imperial and capital	interest	, particularly as represent by the conservative party . but that be what the arrangement be : an alliance rather than a consolidate interest or a genuinely share culture . protestant loyalist dominate the statelet from it formation .
at little up to 1985 , the british government submit to the threat of violence from the loyalist community and accept the protestant loyalist veto on any change in the constitutional structure of they state . with the anglo - irish agreement at hillsborough in 1985 , it have sotch to lie aside that veto , and establish in principle it political right to modify the structure of power and control in ulster by involve the republic of ireland in a common policy on security . however , in the	interest	of western european stability and it own financial position , the british government be perhaps still putte off the final offer either british withdrawal or some form of power - share with catholic nationalist in the hope of loyalist come round to what be see as a much reasonable position . the class structure of northern ireland be predictable dominate by protestant . of course , with the development of international monopoly capital and multinational company , additional source of power have be bring into play .
they small church membership of around 10 , 000 hide the wide appeal paisleyite politics have for the small businessman and farmer of protestant ulster . the setting up of a new form of ulster club organization involve paramilitary activity in the wake of the anglo - irish accord of 1985 , be an added dimension to the struggle for power within the alliance . it be likely that the inner core of local church laity , such as select vestry member of the church of ireland and presbyterian elder , provide and still provide one of the link between the material and spiritual	interest	of the group in the alliance , as this laity be and be active in the business and commercial field also . the dominant beliefs of the two alliances as we examine the dominant beliefs of the two alliance , it must be stress that we be not look at beliefs possess by each and every person who identify to a great or less extent with either set of traditions .
added upset come in the same year from a speech by dr w . starkie , the commissioner of national education in ireland , who attacke school manager for not be up to they job . the attack be within the context of a speech large praise the roman catholic church in ireland . but the church 's clerics still take offence , particularly at the point that local people should be encoura to take an	inter	in the school by have some financial responsibility for they through local government . as priest control the local school directly , this be see to be a direct attack on they role in the school system . eventually the irish party be force to return to westminster to see to it that the appropriate denominational interest in england be strengthen and to show the irish political leadership 's compliance with the similarly organize irish system ( miller 1973 : 7785 ) .
but the church 's clerics still take offence , particularly at the point that local people should be encoura to take an interest in the school by have some financial responsibility for they through local government . as priest control the local school directly , this be see to be a direct attack on they role in the school system . eventually the irish party be force to return to westminster to see to it that the appropriate denominational	interest	in england be strengthen and to show the irish political leadership 's compliance with the similarly organize irish system ( miller 1973 : 7785 ) . this controversy be immediately follow by another . a specially appoint english school inspector report negative on certain aspect of irish school .
the bishop be successful in urge the irish party to accept the church 's programme for irish education as a whole . they success be founded on a dual strategy . on the one hand they subscrib to the annual irish parliamentary party fund and , on the other , they public praise the irish party as the true political representative of the irish people and it	interest	in the british parliament . even a castle bishop such as archbishop healy , now announce he conversion to the nationalist cause . in other word , support for the education policy of the church be the quid the irish party have to give in order to obtain the quo of the bishop 's endorsement of the party as the genuine political representative of the irish people or nation .
the total of that favour denominational school in the initial survey be less than one - third . but , since the open opposition of the clergy , many of that attract by the original idea be clearly dissuade and the majority opposition dwindle away . the clergy have inform the people 's conscience on the basis of what they consider to be the essential religious	interest	of they flock . alternative , from another perspective , the clergy have act to preserve the old division . unfortunately , the one be an inevitable corollary of the other .
work as the fancy take i , he wrote . a little bit here , a little bit there . wherever there be	inter	on the day in question . the absurd idea , he wrote , that a work of art grow from nothing into something , from acear into oak . foster by illusion of paint , which spread out over the surface .
goldberg take out he polka - dot handkerchief and wipe he brow , he cheek , he neck , push aside the typewrite and seize he pen . drag the pad towards he he find a clean page and wrote : dear harsnet , i know you never answer i letter or return i call , and i know that you hand over you note to i on the understanding that i could do what i like with they and not bother you , but i have to say that while there be much in they that i admire , as i will always admire much in you , no matter what , there be also much in they that seem to i to be puerile and , to put it mildly , bigote . i have decide , however , in the	interest	of posterity , to cut nothing , though i may take the liberty of annotat the text here and there , put some of the fact straight and referr the reader to relate document , such as interviews you once give or book and article on you which have since appeare . i know none of this interest you any long , he wrote , and that you hold you , or pretend to hold you , aloof from the world , and in particular from the world of art . you be , or pretend to be , indifferent to whatever may happen to you reputation .
when the history of we time come to be write , they organize they to death will be the only possible epitaph . no doubt they mean well where the arts be concern , he wrote , but for that reason they be the big menace . no doubt they think they have the	interest	of the artist at heart , he wrote , but for that reason they must be avoid like the plague . no doubt they see they as devoted middlewoman , bring the truly important work of the time to the avid mass , but all they be really do , wrote harsnet ( type goldberg ) be fuck up the life of both set of people . they bring time into what be essentially timeless , he wrote .
now i see , he wrote , that i must abandon it as i have abandon everything else . there come a moment when you know you have do what you could do with something and everything else would be fiddl . there come a moment when you lose	inter	so totally that to touch it again would be a physical impossibility . when it be too late to go on and too late to start again . from the begin it be too late , he wrote .
if it be finish i would not say abandon , i say . why he say . i have lose	inter	in it , i say . inter he say . then : can i see it
why do you abandon it he ask again . again i tell he why . sometimes it take a little while to realize you really have lose	inter	in something , i say to he . that it be not that you have get up on the wrong side or eat something which do not agree with you or just need a few day 's rest . it take a little time to sec that you be not move forward any very , either because you do not know how or because there be not anywhere to move forward to .
indeed what we be now see in some case as the genuine article be quality brewery refurbishment date from the 1920 and 1930s , good brewer tudor , maybe , but hardly the stuff of the ancient , inglenooky world that the modern myth - maker the brewer and the tourism industry would have we believe still exist . much of york 's old central pub have fall victim to drastic recent remodell with yawn space , often indistinguishable from one pub to another , replace the old room and idiosyncratic nook and corner that previously give individuality and preser genuine historic character . that two dozen of this interior be in building statutorily list for they special architectural or historic	inter	say much for the low regard pay to pub in the exercise of list building control and indeed for the list process it . a strik example of this be the list description for the blue bell in fossgate , the last perfect - survive victorian pub interior in york and one of only two pub leave in the city of truly national importance . the premise be descri as follow ;
history , indeed , tend to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforce rather than curb market excess . it be the license system and license control , after all , which help to foster britain 's peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hand of the brewer in the first place ; and it be the same system which connive at and partly encoura the modern contagion of open - plan pub design . in addition , the 1989 mmc report , conceive as an attack in the public	inter	on the monopoly power of the major brewer and require the unty of large chunk of they tied estate , may have devastat consequence for traditional pub . for despite they other shortcoming , much of the major brewer have be able and will to cross - subsidise many less profitable house . equally , the brewery - tie system have shelter much pub property in tie tenancy from the harsh wind of the market .
she ale , if new , look like a misty morning , all thick . during the 20 century an historic architectural character perhaps much typically that of the timber frame building have become popular with , and desirable to , both publican and brewer . in many cas this have result in the introduction of faked feature and the associate destruction of exist feature which , though often of architectural and historic	inter	in they own right , do not fit in with the designer 's concept of the pub 's ideal form . artificial plastic beam be frequently introduce , ceiling be strip of plaster to reveal floor joist that be never intended to be see , other timber be artificially blacken to create a supposed traditional though in fact inauthentic black and white effect and render or plaster be remove from wall to produce rustic charm . at the saracen 's head at towcester , for example , a recent proposal to historicise the pub involve extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the bad clich of traditional pub detail , such as bull - eye glass and copper lantern .
although the loss of the original front be regrettable , the present facade be in accord with the general architectural character of the street and retain original late - georgian feature , such as it sash with glazing bar . the pub 's owner , however , wish to remove the 19th century facade and undertake a conjectural restoration of the jetted , timber frame front ( the design of which include various historical inaccurate detail ) . the public clearly believe that this restoration would enhance the building 's	inter	despite destroy an historic element ; he must also have feel that a new timber frame facade , despite it inauthenticity , would give the pub an historic character that be very readily recognisable and instantly attractive to potential customer . if pub owner be prepare to emphasise the interest of genuine historic feature , regardless of period , then this type of fakery , which disappoint or sadly deceive the customer in search of the traditional pub and irreparable remove much of a building 's interest for future generation , could be avoid . georgian frontage of the duke 's arm , presteigne , powy ( andrew arrol ) .

an additional problem face by many georgian pub particularly historic coach inns be the treatment of re - use of stable and other relate outbuilding . as matthew saunder note in the 1983 save/camra report : the freestand stable w , the coachman and ostler accommodation , the skittle alley and cobbled yard can be of the great	inter	and yet be very vulnerable to the ubiquitous need , often enforce by the planning authority , for adequate car park space . indeed such be the pressure for adequate car park that there be a surprise number of cas where brew company have apply for permission to demolish not only outbuilding but adjacent cottage , some of they list a number of the large georgian pub originally accommodate outbuilding to the rear .
the multi - room and historical - eclectic pub need to be protect against the ravage of the all - over designer look . as have be frequently point out , it be no use provide excellent beer or food if the pub in question have lose all of it charm and atmosphere ; and sure a multi - room pub , with a number of differ environments , be the good way to serve what be after all alway a very diverse and unstandardised community . in 1976 the lord chief justice , dismisse bass charrington 's appeal against a proposal to open up the interior at the roman hotel in southwick , sussex , declare that it might be undesirable in the public	inter	to see much public bar disappear and much merger of public and saloon bar of the kind in question here in addition , far good liaison need to be establish between the brewery and local authority conservation and plan officer , english heritage , the national amenity societies , local civic body and , of course , pub landlord and they clientele over plan pub refurbishment . in particular , license magistrate and fire and health authority should be make much aware of the character and need of historic building .
the inter - war period see the construction of a large number of new pub to serve the need of grow suburban community and reconstruct city centr . this usually reflect tudor or georgian style , sometimes with intentional accuracy , very often in an impressionistic way . the spread of motoring cause a revival of	inter	in the tradition of wayside coach inns , since this be rediscover as charm nostalgic example of bygone day , and the charm of the wayside inn be celebrate in the verse of hilaire belloc and rupert brooke . run a modern - day coach inn become a fashionable activity after the painter john fothergill take on the spread eagle at thame in the 1920 and , late , the three swan at market harborough . a melancholic figure dress in black , he seem to have specialise in overhung jug hare and insult to he customer .
e . midland show worry over ubr a survey of the tourism industry in the east midlands have highlight concern over the uniform business rate ( ubr ) . and with 1992 and the dismantling of trade barrier within europe fast approach , the spring east midlands tourism business survey also reveal a disturb lack of	inter	in language train . the survey , sponsore by pannell kerr forster , the east midlands tourist board ( emtb ) and nottingham polytechnic show that 63 % of all hotel in the region believe the ubr have a detrimental effect on business . and among medium - siz hotel with a turnover of between 100 , 000 and 1m , 54 % be concern about the impact of the ubr .
the main difference between the two style of cuisine be in the way the chinis blend ingredient , how they introduce colou into the food , and that up to 90 % of the work be do prior to cook . import the ingredient through swholesale have not be a problem . the lotus leaf need to line the bamboo steamer for the szechwan dish of steame beef and rice flour be examine with	inter	, as be the ingredient use to make the rice flou short grain rice , cinnamon bark , star anise and special wild pepper which be then saute dry for 15 minute and ground into a semolina - type texture after the removal of the bark and anise . left and above , chef xu zhengcai demonstrate to professional caterer at a master class xu 's ingredient be fresh and he use just one board
off - site training be far very effective , charle mobb as lodgistix account manage phillip wanbon point out , different package require different timescale for training , but he add : we do guarantee to stay on site until we be fully satisfy that all the relevant personnel within the hotel or conference centre be competent enough to run an efficient operation with minimal help from we . this be of course in we own	interest	. train on - site can cose anything in the range of 200 to 350 per day . train cours at the supplier 's own premise be typically charge on a daily delegate rate structure like the tariff for hotel conference .

mostly 8 to 10in high , they be distinguish by brilliantly colour flower . greigii tulip also tend to be short , in particular variety like sweet lady , peach pink , and the impressive queen ingrid , produce rich red petal with a strik yellow edge . in addition they mottle leaf significantly extend the season of	inter	, so be quite sure to allow enough space for they to reach they full potential glory . out of the increasingly popular specy tulip , i favourite be tulipa tarda , originally from central asia . long - last flower appear in spring , they green - ting , white petal gradually shad th bright yellow towards the centre .

when student be learn to glide , the instructor be not only teach they the technique of fly a glider , but also how to make decision and judgement in the air . the final stage of train amount to the hand over of all the responsibility for safety to the student . ideally , the student should be make all the decision and choose action in the	interest	of safety and efficiency . by set the student problem during the final flight before go solo , the instructor can test he ability to think logically and to deal with situations as they arise . an experience instructor will stop help the student at this stage and will refuse to commend until after each flight .
above all it be vital for every pilot to have the old adage safety first indelible imprint on they mind . in other word , if in doubt , do not take a chance . the mature glide pilot would never hesitate to make a fool of he in the	interest	of safety . however , it be not just beginner who make mistake and get catch out . on one occasion a very experience pilot in a nimbus 2 be start on a car launch when it swing off the runway into a k8 which be some distance ahead .

however , i have never see a copy of this circulate at the subdivision level at any location i have work ; and outside force hq the availability of any research or analytic literature on police fall off dramatically . ho circular ( 194/78 ) describe british and american research literature on policing be another typically apologetic , anti - intellectual document , for within it first few paragraph it admit : the implication of attempt to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officer about research finding , or collect , collate and distribute research of	inter	to the police service , and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable . there be no plan to establish such a centre . no one seem to have ask whether the staff college could have take on this job , but then again such anti - intellectualism be apparend even in the bramshill scholar ' association .
the form continue , lis other section of the act . it make it abundantly clear that even the possession and academic presentation of information necessary for an ethnography could be actionable . for a considerable amount of inconsequential information own by the institution be classe as confidential , even though it release could only be consider prejudicial to the safety and	interest	of the state by the much bigoted autocrat . the need to get the retir member to sign such a document indicate the institutional fear of the outside lie behind the threat which sir peter imbert issue to that who would write controversial memoir ( police review , 26 august 1988 ) ; for the family demand silence unto death from it member ! and even if an uncommissioned but critical ethnography be not consider to be in breach of the official secrets act , it will much likely be construe as structural espionage and lie in breach of the police discipline code as set out in police regulation .
favret - saada 's unique analysis ( ibid . 128 ) of the bizarre subjective position she find he in be a masterful assessment of the difficulty which arise when the ethnographer seek to gain knowledge of a social group which depend for it existence on misknowledge or silence : for anyone who want to understand the meaning of such a discourse , there be no other solution but to practise it one , to become one 's own informant and to try and make explicit what one find unstatable in one . for it be difficult to see how the native could have any	inter	in the project of unveile what can go on exist only if it remain veil . ( ibid . 22 ) in succum to the temptation of subjectivism ( ibid . 23 ) , she recognize that it become impossible to put any distance between one and the native , or very important between one and one in such a situation .

here be piaget 's much well - know demonstration of the infant 's failure to relate action to experience . at about seven month of age the average baby be quite skilled at remove obstacle to prehension ; be well able , for example , to pull a cushion away to reach a rattle behind it . however , if the rattle slip down so far that it be no long visible , the infant will at once lose	inter	and behave as if the rattle have also slip out of existence . by about eight month of age many infant be capable of retrieve completely hide object ; but between eight and twelve month they show another intrigue pattern of error . there be now two occluder , a and b , side - by - side before the infant .
( this do not , unlike the piagetian method , rely on the baby do anything intentionally such as reach . it allow the psychologist to determine whether the subject have detect a change in a stimulus or can discriminate between two stimuli . ) initially the subject will attend to a new stimulus but will then gradually lose	inter	( dishabituation ) then we can assume that the baby have detect the change . another technique be preferential look . if the subject prefer to look at one stimulus rather than another we can assume that he have detect a difference between they .

sadly he die shortly afterwards and for many reason it be some month before i use the disc . the advent of the arbortech carve competition at the 1990 woodworker show give i the idea of put the tool to some good use . i grandfather have always take a keen	inter	in i work , and i have an equal admiration of the storie of he time spend in burma during the second world war . therefore it seem fit that as a tribute to he and he comrade i produce a sculpture with this tool . the stron image i get from he storie and subsequent research be of the oppressive jungle and heat in which the soldier fight .

such policy also pay only for hospital - relate treatment , and many exclude treatment which do not include invasive technique . thus , therapy for a particular ailment may specifically be exclude from a policy , whilst surgery would be cover . the choice of treatment may be skew towards that which can be pay for , rather than that which may be in the good	interest	of or prefer by the patient . drugs budgets . age concern believe that gp should be encoura to make rational , efficient , effective and economic use of resource in relation to prescri , and that the use of drug for elderly people should be closely monitore .

the notebook show svidrigailov develop from a minor into a major character while crime and punishment be be plan and write , and they show he growth as interdependent with raskolnikov 's final definition . in some early draft raskolnikov commit suicide , and the strik thing here be that it be never suggest he do so out of remorse or because he think he be go to get catch or even from some vaguer , large self - loath . he appear to lose	inter	in life . he be bore . sonya ask he , i do not understand : how will thing be for you , how will you marry and have child of course think about he estrangement from human kind ; and he reply ( dostoevsky 's italic ) : i will get use to it .
but on the last page of the novel life have take the place of dialectics , and raskolnikov be on he way home . meanwhile svidrigailov have take over the suicide role , which be to say the blanket boredom have become positively terminal . you know , i take no particular	inter	in anything , he tell raskolnikov musingly on they first encounter ; especially now , i have nothing to occupy i . in he time he have try a lot of thing : card - shar , prison , wife - thrash and perhaps wife - murder , child - violation , even good work . he contemplate balloon - travel and a journey to the north pole .
they also have a gain setting which will allow a field of this magnitude not to overload the output of the stage . this be useful in set the zero field output correct . field in the range of	inter	be usually measure in gamma , one gauss be 100, 000 gamma . the total component of the earth 's magnetic field in the uk be around 47 000 gamma inclin at around 67 to the horizontal . the particular core and wind arrangement use in the design have an intrinsic sensitivity of about 12mv/gauss or 0.12v/gamma .
measur current with light another area of activity for king 's be in fibre optics . research project preside over by professor alan roger include the identification of large molecule , such as that of	inter	in medical test , the production of fibre laser , and the design of distribute measur system . one of the project close to commercial realisation use optical fibre to sense a current flowing in a conductor . the interesting part be that the measur fibre do not need to be part of the current carry circuit , give a high degree of electrical isolation .
however , when the fibre be put into a spatially vary magnetic field , a phenomenon call faraday rotation come into play . this effectively change the polarisation direction , and can cause couple between the two mode . so , if the current of	inter	can be make to produce a magnetic field which vary in the right way along the length of the fibre , this can be use to measure current . danny mcstay and welland chu be the researcher work on the project . they have devise several way of produce the required magnetic field , include a slotted busbar ( such as might be use in a pow station ) around which the fibre can be wrap .
once , roland barthes he come . kermode recall the seminar as occasion of good humour and tolerance , despite sharp intellectual disagreement , and he lament that they humane spirit do not survive late event . by the late seventy some british academics be display a wary but sympathetic	inter	in early or classical structuralism , particularly as it be expound in culler 's wide read structuralist poetics , a lucid , urbane work which suggest that structuralism might , without too much difficulty , be adopt to exist academic practice . i be partly convince by culler 's power of persuasion , and for some time think that the kind of analyse he descri could be assimilate to practical criticism and the english synthesis . eventually i decide that assimilation be not possible , give culler 's lack of interest in the interpretation of particular text and he commitment to the uncovering of the generalize principle of literariness .

hawkes have dismiss the idea of objectivity and truth in structuralism and semiotics , but nuttall insist that such dismissal be pragmatically self - refut . we may assert that there be no such thing as truth , but we regard that as a true statement . the point have a particular relevance to the work of that who believe , like foucault , follow nietzsche , that truth be a mere rhetorical device , employ in the	interest	of oppression , and say so at length . what then be the status of foucault 's say so nevertheless , the very concept of truth seem to be an irritant for some .
furthermore , attacks such as crew 's be , as he acknowledge , not take serious and reply to in they own term , but treat as symptoms of repress disturbance . freudian , like marxist , cannot step outside they own form of think to admit that they might be wrong ( littunle , like crew , they undergo a deconversion ) . the recent revival of	inter	in psychoanalysis among literary theorist have come from france , and in particular from the work of jacques lacan , who bring together freud and saussure and produce the slogan , the unconscious be structure like a language . lacan have be very influential , although he be an almost impenetrable obscure write . the obscurity be not incidental , a product of carelessness or incompetence in write , but a deliberate attempt to enact the wayward process of the unconscious .
at the same time , there be an ambiguity in this backward open of the canon . much of the work that be rediscover may have the literary quality that will satisfy reader without particular feminist interest : the poem by woman that roger lonsdale include in the new oxford book of eighteen - century verse be a small - scale , easy accessible instance . nevertheless , in a feminist academic context write may well be study , not primarily for it literary but for it cultural	inter	. this question provoke argument in america about the norton anthology of literature by women , some of the content of which be say to have have little value as literature . a common feminist response be to say that the whole idea of literary standard , even standard as such , be a form of male domination .
he remain some kind of marxist , and he concept of the carnivalesque , draw from rabelais , be present as a mode of ideological subversion , a pull down of the mighty from they seat . it will take time for the implication of he work to be properly assimilate and understand ; the process involve transposition from a cultural context that be very remote than the french . but the growing	inter	in it suggest that it offer both a possible way out of present impass and a way forward . who be derrida , what be he during the 1980 the star of french think fall from the heavens at a disconcert rate .
non - evaluative criticism , as propound by the successive merton professor , gardner and carey , have long be a popular ideal at oxford . but another oxford professor , john bayley , see thing differently . discuss a book on dostoevsky , he remark that while the author have much of	inter	to say about the idiot she do not quite persuade one that it come off , indeed she do not really try , because like many scholar today she be very concern with show how the thing works than with judge if it work well . from the begin academic literary study be divide between that who see it as inevitable involve with make judgement and that who do not . cambridge english represent the former : richards and leavis want an evaluative criticism , because they do not believe that literature be simply a matter of disinterest individual response ; it be an index to the condition of civilization , which make judgement imperative .
ventur to propound a law of intellectual life , i suggest that evaluative criticism enter institutional literary study under the influence of practise writer , or of critic who have a close discipular relation to they , but that in time it be reject , like an alien organ . writer , who criticism arise directly from the problem and possibility of they art , be inevitable evaluative ; baudelaire show how be a poet also involve be a critic . eliot be early and good criticism be what he call workshop criticism , an attempt to realign literary tradition in the	interest	of the kind of poetry he want to write . leavis , at the begin of he career a whole - heart admir of eliot , take over eliot 's tentative critical model and systematize they . late he respond in a similar way to d . h . lawrence 's criticism , as well as to he creative achievement .
she probably know very about the nineteen century industrial novel than anyone else in the entire world . how can all that knowledge be condense into a fifty - minute lecture to student who know almost nothing about it the	interest	of scholarship and pedagogy be at odd here . what roby , like to do be to deconstruct the text , to probe the gap and absence in they , to uncover what they be not say , to expose they ideological bad faith , to cut a cross - section through the twisted strand of they semiotic code and literary convention . what the student want she to do be to give they some basic fact that will enable they to read the novels as simple straightforward reflection of reality , and to write simple , straightforward , exam - pass essay about they .
he have do he initial research on jane austen , but since then have turn he attention to topic as vary as medieval sermon , elizabethan sonnet sequence , restoration heroic tragedy , eighteen - century broadside , the novels of william godwin , the poetry of elizabeth barrett browning and premonition of the theatre of the absurd in the play of george bernard shaw . none of this project have be complete . seldo , indeed , have he draw up a preliminary bibliography before he attention be distract by some new or revive	inter	in something entire different . he run hither and thither between the shelf of eng . light . like a child in a toyshop so reluctant to choose one item to the exclusion of other that he ended up empty - hand .
what good inspiration could a literature of theory have than an audience compose of theorist and critic this be not , i think , mean to be ironical , and it represent a quite logical development from the premiss that the whole production , definition , and reception of literature have now become intramural to the academy . in this context , what go on outside , what be actual write by poet and novelist , be of minor	inter	. paul de man be report to have say that a literary work be mere an event in the history of interpretation . a natural response to this state of affair would be to say that theory cut off from the write of literature be no much than a sterile academicism .
dempsey in change place and small world be an approximate british equivalent . ) zapp want the subject to be organize , systematic , objective , in a word though it be not a word he use scientific . there be to be no nonsense about value , preferr some book or author to other , or personal response , which have a mere anecdotal or autobiographical	inter	. worke on jane austen be not all that different from work on trade cycle , or lowtemperature physics ; this be the kind of thing that go on in the modern university . admitted , in he late appearance zapp have go poststructuralist , and abandon system and objectivity ; but he commitment to professionalism be great than ever .
an awkward truth though be that in the twenty century some of the much committed political criticism have come from conservative , like eliot and the southern agrarian . an erudite work by an oxford new historicist , david norbrook 's poetry and politics in the english renaissance , illustrate the structuralist truism that in a binary group one of the two term tend to assume dominance . norbrake 's	inter	be clearly far very in politics than in poetry . the much significant aspect of the new historicism , political question apart , be that it represent a move away from the contextless , intensive concentration on particular text equally characteristic of the new criticism , classical structuralism , and deconstruction . this have major pedagogic implication , since student can no long hope to make sense of poem or play just by read they careful , but must spend time in library get up on the historical context .
i be very sympathetic to it , and have try to put it into effect in some of i own write , but there be an accompany danger that literature become absorb by culture , and that literary value be supersed by cultural one . this may seem innocuous and acceptable , but the implication should be understand . the kind of poem that a literary critic would regard as banal , ill - write , shallow in feel , and platitudinous in sentiment , might have major human	inter	for the cultural historian . grant that there be an absolute need for humanistic value to prevail in a neo - utilitarian and materialistic age , one be face with a significant divergence in the nature of this value . the experience of read major works of literature can have an overpower effect on the responsive reader ( usually , but by no means invariable , the young reader ) .
malcolm bradbury 's story , the adult education class , nicely dramatize the difficulty and danger . adult classes , in fact , require exceptionally good teach , of a kind that may be remote from the professional ideal of many presentday academics . at the present time , there be much	inter	in the english past , evoke in exhibition commemorat historical event , and evident in the spread of museum and the great popularity of visit country home . this interest have several aspect . one of they , as the left disapprovingly point out , be a mythologize version of past greatness which obfuscate the disagreeable reality of the present .
the michelin guide to the cte de l 'atlantique say that this eerie and impressive cavern , which communicate by a passage through the cliff to the chteau on the summit , be probably make in the twelfth century to shelter the relic of the holy sepulchre at jerusalem bring back from a crusade by pierre ii of castillon , who at that time hold the chteau . now pound have interest he a great deal in the order of the templar , to which pierre of castillon belong . in fact it be the templar , some of who ritual survive in the practice of modern freemasonry , who account for pound 's	inter	in poitier , one of they principal centre . in the thirteen century the king of france , abet by a weak pope , very brutally suppress the order of templar and appropriate they enormous wealth . the grandmaster of the order at this time be jacques de molay .
it would be tedious to quote and consider every one of the tribute that pound pay to binyon . one be at the end of gaudier - brzeska ( 1916 ) ; another be in a criterion article of 1937 , d'artagnan twenty year after ; in that year appear polite essay , which include pound 's review of binyon 's translation of the inferno ( originally in the criterion for april 1934 ) ; there be two tribute to binyon in guide to kulchur ( 1938 ) ; in 1948 at st elizabeth 's pound be still press binyon on the attention of charle olson ; and as late as 1958 he take the opportunity of pavanne and divagation to get back into print he appreciative note on the flight of the dragon . none of this item be without	inter	. but hell , the review of binyon 's inferno , be particularly important ; for it may well be one of the much careful and illuminat act of criticism that pound ever perform . it include this passage :
the teutonic mind , he say quickly , be no favourite of he : mussolini , he imply , do not particularly dislike the jew . it be necessary to turn back to ezra 's childhood to find a key to that dire impatience which have lead he into so strange a spiritual home as fascist italy . it be , ala , the spoile and wilful child who make whips and bloodsh take the place of wisdom and social	inter	! nevertheless in ezra we be deal with a creative artist who never however impatient he be sell he birthright for a mess of pottage . ezra can be mistaken very thorough mistaken than many people but he have never be venal .
by sarah hogg the chancellor be try to convince he political audience that britain 's deficit ( now run at close on 4 per cent of national income ) be not a problem ; and to convince the market not to sell sterl . in both argument , the next two week which include a probable german	inter	- erat rise and an unavoidable conservative party conference will be critical . if mr lawson can hold off a base rate rise at little until he can blame the german , that will make he political task a fraction easy ; but not much . the balance of payment be a circular identity of inflow and outflow , which must necessarily match each other .
in 1988 the group have 8, 000 employee , of who 500 be outside france . very important , perhaps , cb be an unusual organisation . as a massive lender which take no deposit , a marketer of industrial and consum finance , and increasingly a purveyor of insurance - relate product to an under - insure french public , cb probably embody a unique combination of strategy and	interest	. there be definitely no parallel in britain . cb originate in the ruin of france one year after the end of the second world war as union financiere d 'enterprise francaise et etrangere .
since we be in the middle of the international coffee organisation meet - how do they pass a week without a visible result i think it appropriate to think about tea . it be not such a perverse idea , because a lot of people have recently become interested in that noble beverage . as always , the	inter	be not unconnect with a little matter of price . at last monday 's weekly london teum auction , price reach they highest for three year . many in the trade expect price to go up far today , and possible for quite a few auction to come .
but he stress : it be only an idea , not a proposal , and it need a lot much work . the hill samuel plan envisage split off the uk naval and avionics business and give shareholder one share in the new company for every share they hold in the exist organisation . talk be believe to have be hold with thorn em i , who defence	interest	be up for sale . a successful merger could create a defence company with estimate sale of 800m . ferranti 's naval and avionics business be think to have a turnover of about 500m .
it be the business of the head of the established church to express he worry about the state of the nation and the moral mood of the time . it would be foolish and unseemly as well as counter - productive for the prime minister to enter into an undignify slange match with he every time he do so . if dr runcie see self -	inter	, self - righteousness and an intolerant and uncharitable disregard for the unsuccessful and the unemployed , it be not mere he right but he duty to speak out . if , far , he feel that the free market policy and value embrace by mrs thatcher have do much to create a divided nation , dominate by pharisee , he should feel free to offer he opinion . this be not , however , to say that dr runcie be correct .
there have be row over cattle - graze and other encroachment . fortunately , this year 's monsoon be short but sharp , and improve water management have produce good flood . dr vijayan also report that after a long struggle to arouse they	inter	, pakistani environmentalist be aware of the threat to the bird . but the war rag on in afghanistan , and crane protection be understandable a low priority in kabul . the war , and the region 's complex geopolitical concern , be also prevent naturalist from undertak the much effective means of monitor the siberian crane - ring the flock with miniature transmitter that could be track from space .

alternative divid line which have be informally moote , such as simply restrict solicitor - advocate in crown court jury trial to the less serious case , have be view as difficult to support as a matter of principle . lord donaldson 's remark be greet with cautious enthusiasm by bar leader . desmond fennell , qc , the bar 's chairman , say that he be great encoura by lord donaldson 's indication that the	interest	of justice objective would prevail . roger henderson , qc , the bar 's public affair spokesman , warn that the word use in the white paper be open to different interpretation , but say : lord donaldson have plainly interpret the white paper on the basis that there have be a major change from the green paper . john hayes , secretary general of the law society , say he regard the entire matter as up for debate .

a high - powered group of finance director have urge the government to consider give great commercial freedom to nationalise industry such as british rail and the post office rather than privatise they outright . they should be make to correspond very closely with private sector practice and allow the freedom to borrow from the market place , the group say . they should also be give permission to issue some form of fixe	inter	profight - relate bond , be allow to raise a proportion of they equity direct from the public and be subject to independent regulation similar to that of privatised utility . this be the main recommendation of a report from the hundred group of senior british finance director , publish yesterday and circulate to minister and senior civil servant . at the moment nationalise industry be severe restrict in the way they borrow money .

they accept an objectionable , racially - discriminatory basis on which hong kong citizenship would be decide . they accept limitation on the jurisdiction of hong kong 's post - 1997 supreme court , and proposal which would diminish the independence of judge . they refrain from responde to a long series of statement by senior chinese official which contradict both the letter and the spirit of the joint declaration - include an assurance , for example , that the post - 1997 hong kong press would be free for as long as it do not publish anything detrimental to china 's national	inter	. london be all too obviously sell hong kong down the pearl river , despite it protestation to the contrary . even now , and though the events of june trigger a brief period of reappraisal , the british still seem besot by they vision of china as a billion - strong market for they good and service and either unaware , or unimpress , that they export to hong kong it be currently worth three time as much as that to it northern neighbour .
we be strong now on woman 's right , the environment and disarmament . this sort of language dismay the traditional rank of spd supporter , especially the big trade union , who fear they voice within the party be be muffle . it have not always be easy for that work class voter who see the greens as an undisciplined bunch , inimical to the	interest	of industrial society , to keep up with the spd 's enthusiastic appetite for environmental matter . there have be a noticeable shift of work class support from the spd to the far - right republican not as much as the loss from the christian democrat , but enough to worry party manager . the difference in we electorate be much big than for the conservative party , say heidi wieczorek - zeul , a member of the party praesidium .

the party leader , han - jochen vogel , a rather uninspir figure , have nonetheless prove adeep at manage this delicate evolution which , bold than anything the labour party ever contemplate , have avoid the sort of fratricidal bloodlett which ravage it british counterpart . the traditionalist camp have have to swallow some bitter pill . oskar lafontaine , the spd leader in the saarland , have argue vociferously that a modern mass party like the spd could not afford to have it policy confin to the narrow	interest	of employ industrial worker . in the party 's new programme , the trade union have have to backtrack on they central demand , now accept that a shorter work week will mean reduce wage . but mr lafontaine , standard - bearer of the up - and - come generation , and the second much important figure after mr vogel on the committee draft the party programme for the next decade , have certainly not have thing all he own way .

commercial pressure be hostile to the creation of space , except in the much limit and functional sense , either inside or out . the ideal interior be neutral and unobstruct , while the demand for floor area push building to the limit of they site , make public space , or any but the thinn facade , unprofitable . as the creation of space be the primary concern , it be not surprise the	interest	of developer and of the well - be of city be so often in conflict . the struggle between commercial pressure and good architecture be an unequal one , on which many developer be not prepare to expend much energy . they value they architect very for they business demeanour than for they design , and choose they from a limit number of establish company , very value for reliability than originality .

even during the recorded period , however , there be persuasive reason for believe that the actual quantity of reserf use for intervention be at little 650m - 700m . sale of reserf be offset by an inflow of 260m of foreign currency receipt from the final instalment of the sale of british steel share . and the net change be reduce by	inter	on the 42.88bn of outstand reserf probably wor between 250m and 300m a month . then there be the tricky question of forward market operation . the bank be know frequently to support the pound in the forward market .

whatever form it take , it offer no personal recognition or status , and nor should it . it be necessary , however , that society recognise the importance of car for other as a fundamental part of living . no one would deny that enterprise and competitiveness be important ; but what we see around we today be the elevation of self -	inter	as something to be applaude . if we be bring up to accept the doctrine of look after number one , it be not surprise to find the result of that upbringing reflect in society . this inevitable lead to a climate in which the likelihood of give not only money but also one 's time be reduce .
it be shrewd of mr kinnock to attempt to enlist this mood and to link labour with such concept as patriotism , efficiency and plain common sense , virtue which have very often be associate with the conservative party . similarly , it be shrew of he to play for the internationalist vote after a prolong period of sull little englandism during which labou threaten to withdraw from the common market and call into question this country 's role within nato . increase the prime minister be regard by many swing voter as unconstructive and isolationist rather than a determined defender of british	interest	. she , and not mr kinnock , be constant at odd with the european community and the commonwealth . a stance which be appropriate for the age of brezhnev and galtieri now seem out of date and out of touch with the spirit of the time .
there be no question here of the swing of the pendulum . it be rather comfort in a way . chesterton say that tradition be the democracy of the dead but in france the dead get a seat in parliament , together with three secretary each ,	inter	- free loan , subsidise foreign travel and an income of about 40 , 000 , half of which be tax free . that who attack the senate say that it should be abolish , that it be useless and corrupt . that who defend it say that it repesent an area of moderation and wisdom in french democracy and that both be sore need .

for many reader , le monde 's view of the world be france 's view of the world . that view be present in a classical french , rare illustrate , and then only with the small photograph or the occasional line draw . it follow an editorial policy that believe foreign news should lead the first three page , that matter of national	inter	should be philosophically debate in the newspaper 's column , and that half a page of sport either side of the weekend be enough . have survive a financial crisis in the early 1980 , thank to support from the bank and from a staff prepare to agree to a voluntary wage freeze , the paper be now make money and put on reader , so why have the management now decide to modernise the title on first sight it might seem a case of plus can change , plus c'est la meme choose .

if the verderer ( or they heir , if the verderer have die in the mean time ) fail to present they roll to the judge on the first day of the for eyre , or if they roll be deficient in any material particular , they be liable to amercement . at the huntingdonshire for eyre of 1255 the forester and verderer present a clerk and he page for a trespass against the venison . the	judgment	of the court be that because the verderer and the steward of the forest make no mention in they roll of the name of the said page , nor of he delivery , nor of he escape , and the business of the king so far as it relate to the said boy be entirele undone , therefore they be in mercy . but the verderer be final acquit ,
the local gentry and other be present for take the deer , which they have probably be accustom to do for generation with little interference . other presentment concern the unwarrant felling of tree and cutt of branch in the for coppice , and the overburdening of the for pasture with unauthorize number of cattle , sheep and pig . to give	judgment	upon this presentment , the ancient machinery of the for eyre be once very set in motion after a long period of general disuse . between 1488 and 1490 eyre be hold in the berkshire and surrey division of windsor for , in hampshire , wiltshire , northamptonshire , essex , buckinghamshire and huntingdonshire . the court roll show that the for law have be general disregard , and that the k 's deer have be hunt and the for timber fel on a large scale .
intere rate would have to be higher and there be a risk that a labour government face difficult choice would be tempt to devalue sterling , as fear by financial market . despite labour 's plan to raise tax by 6.8 billion in a full year , the analysis say it would be unable to fund it election spend promise beyond initial move to raise pension and child benefit and a mode recovery programme . the report make no	judgment	on labour 's tax plan . however , it argue that vat increase will be require whichever party be in power if public borrowing be to be reduce . implicit in this analysis be the view that labour would have little scope for raise additional revenue by further increase in income tax directe at the good - off .
it be the great struggle despite all this economy measure to scrape together the vat payable by july 31 , say the judgment . the result be there be very little money leave in the kitty to meet the bill but even so the payment be just two week late . i have no doubt that it be this misfortune that cause the appellant 's financial difficulty , one huge bad debt and the loss of regular valuable business , say the	judgment	. mr anderson tell the tribunal he could not apply for bad debt relief until 12 month after the debt have arise while custom have penalise he for pay the vat a mere 16 day late . he say : i feel i have establish a precedent for argue that if there be a genuine reason why one have not get the cash to pay the tax the surcharge should be waive .

iwp be a holding company with interest in the unite kingdom , holland and the republic of ireland . city : shipp safety short - term political and commercial	judgment	can lead to commercial advantage but threaten a long - term commitment to ship safety and quality , say lloyd 's register chairman sir roderick macleod in the 1991 report publish yesterday . city : cooper clarke up bolton - base building product distributor cooper clarke return to the black with a 126 , 000 profit in the eight month to end - december , compare with a 274, 000 loss in the previous year to end - april .
the scandal be that a supine and cowardly press have allow it to be intimidate into censor the truth even though it distort we entire view of reality . the question , do it matter sanswe it . of course it matter if people be deliberately robb of the means of	judgment	by suppression of fact which , in any other situation , would be regarde as necessary to make sense of what have take place . only one of the many newspaper i read mention the fact that the assailant be black and it be with the much extreme difficulty that i be able to ascertain from reporter and policeman , who all refuse to be name , that the callous passer - by be also black . but it be very important ; it change the whole picture .
personal , however , diderot seem to have be genial and agreeable . he quarrel with rousseau after be on intimate term with he , but then everybody do . he be jealous of voltaire 's renown , but he	judgment	of he , not entire favourable , be sound enough . he make , like many intellectual , rather a fool of he when flatter by people in power in he case , catherine . all the same , despite he intelligence and charm , diderot be perhaps less intereste in he than as a symptom and influence .
a measure of the difference between mr major 's personal stand and mrs thatcher be be that , whereas a mere 19 per cent of voter on friday and saturday say they think mr major would make the bad prime minister , nearly double that proportion , 34 per cent , think the same of mrs thatcher five year ago . svote clearly have no difficulty distinguish between real politics and the american show - biz variety . they be prepare to rate the party 's campaign in the style of drama critic review theatrical performance , at the same time for separate	judgment	about the party ' and leader 's ability to govern . ask to say who have campaign much impressive , 32 per cent name mr ashdown and the liberal democrat , 27 per cent mr kinnock and the labour party and only 23 per cent mr major and the conservative . they vote preference be , of course , in the reverse order .
it be a brutal and cowardly attack on wretch creature who offence place they at the bottom of the prison heap , he say . he tell taylor , who appear in the dock wear a dark suit with a small teddy bear mascot on the breast pocket , that parliament have lay down a maximum sentence of 10 year for an appropriate case and to deter that who take the law into they own hand . in i	judgment	this be an appropriate case . i cannot imagine a bad , he say . the bad riot in british penal history start during a sunday morning service in the strangeway chapel .
emma brodie die in frenchgate shop centre in doncaster after be stab through the heart with a carve knife by carol barratt , 24 , who have attack another child in the same place week early . trent regional health authority order an inquiry into why dr neil silvester , a consultant psychiatrist at doncaster royal infirmary , have authorise barratt 's early release . it conclude that dr silvester have be guilty of a serious error of professional	judgment	and order he to take a six - month retrain course . doncaster health authority confirm yesterday that it have make an undisclosed payment to mr rod brodie and he wife , valerie , both 38 . it say : the health authority do not accept legal liability but , in view of the unique and tragic circumstance of this case , have agree to make a contribution to the family of an undisclosed sum .
final , he be public warn and bar from communion , and the people advise to have nothing to do with he . this be in order to convince he of he misery and the necessity of true repentance and reformation . after this he would rail and curse at richard baxter 's door and would prophesy	judgment	against kidderminster in the market place . one time he try to murder richard baxter in the churchyard . however , when he grab richard baxter 's cloak it come away , and before he could do any very harm a couple of by - stander restrain he and haule he off to the magistrate .
put another way , it be discipline , not punishment , which constitute the connect thread run through the diverse range of probation practice . this point be make by one commentator during the first review of the probation system at the begin of this century : he comment remain pertinent for the home office in they current review at the end of the century . probation be a test or trial of the character of a convict offender under suspension of	judgment	, in order that the court may determine if the probationer be fit to retain he or she place as a helpful member of society , or be unfit , must be deprive of he or she liberty as a menace to society . it be establish for the purpose of correction and oversight . it be a conditional freedom .
nor , it seem , do they even suspect the existence of station x . after all , bletchley be an important railway junction , and the line gleam in the moonlight could have be an aid to enemy reconnaissance plane and bomber . indeed , the r.a.f be know to use railway track as navigational guideline . but the location 's convenience for that oxbridge dons who form the nucleus of the original community have weigh down the scale against possible danger of discovery ; and this	judgment	be vindicate , because we be never bomb . this be as well , for even a single light raid would have reduce the flimsy hut to matchwand . for we part , we appear to take for grant the german 's total ignorance of we presence , for we have no air - raid drill , nor do we have a single air - raid shelter , slit - trench , sandbag blast - wall , nor even so much as a steel helmet only a large poster which read :

he have express so often the depth of he love and have make it clear to i that i have give mean to he life . he would not have presume to tell i how to conduct the remainder of i . one of i friend say he be a romantic boy who think he bore a charmed life , but i argue that this be a superficial	judgment	. romantic he certainly be , but i feel there be a deep layer of consciousness from which he have decide to take a calculate risk , fully believe he would survive . no one be very eager for life , and none good equip to live it fully .
the great plantain ( plantago major ) be know as saint patrick 's bowl . hemlock ( conium maculatum ) have the gaelic name of , which it be suggest by cameron , be possibly from the word for feather , . although there be also other gaelic name for hemlock , the biblical reference in hosea x . 4 use this name : ( thus	judgment	springeth up like a hemlock in the furrow of the field ) . hemlock water - dropwort ( oenanthe crocata ) , however , have a gaelic name that suggest another kind of imagery : bog , mean gentle deceit . it be say to have be give to prisoner as poison from the time of pliny , and many reference agree that it be also the plant with which socrates be poison .
many christian start to worry that christian faith be be make to rest upon the mere provisional conclusion of historian . theologian point to what be dub the ugly broad ditch of a d . lesse , namely that accidental truths of history cannot be the basis of necessary truths of reason . the belief of christian could not , it be say , rest upon historical	judgment	, because this belief as truth of reason would then depend upon the truths of history , which be only accidental ( in other word , they might not be the case ) . a conclusion be only as strong as it premise . if the premise might not be true , then the conclusion also might not be true .
but dillon lj say : if the lea do not it decide the special educational provision that should be make for the child , but leave that to be decide by the school , with remedial classes and other facility as may be available in the school , the lea be not it determi the special educational provision for the child within the meaning in section 7 ( 1 ) ; consequently , the lea be not oblige to make and maintain a statement . a decision to leave what be to be do for a particular child to the school be not it , in i	judgment	, a determination of the special educational provision for the child which would necessitate the make of a statement . the lashford case thus demonstrate the extent of lea discretion under the 1981 act . hannon 's prognosis of the act , that lea will be able to draw the line between the statement and the unstatement where they please , would appear to have be accurate .
what freedom teacher may have in this area centre principally on they delivery of the national curriculum . in this regard reference may within the programme of study teacher will be free to determine the detail of what should be teach , although it ur teacher to prepare scheme of work to ensure consistency within a school . there will be full scope for professional	judgment	, both in relation to teach and organisation of the curriculum ; and there will be sufficient flexibility in the choice of content to adap what they teach to the need of the individual pupil . it would appear that all teacher will be place in a similar position to that of teacher prepare pupil for external examination , in that they will have set objectif , or learn outcomes , to be achieve , but will be free to plan they lesson as they think fit especially where the core subject be concern . some of the other foundation subject , such as art or pe , will have far little detail at and ps .

at group level , the day have go when three prisoner per group ( one from the west , the east and a non - aligned country ) be obligatory . nowadays , impartiality need not be express quite so crudely , and a look at any group 's case load will show that a balance be always maintain . in the 1961 observer article that launch amnesty , benenson list the aim of the	organization	. they include : to enlarge the right of asylum and help political refugee to find work . adherence to this state principle have never falter , but other area of concern take precedence and it be not until the late 1970 that this area of work be develop .
the british section refugee office have play a lead role in this area of work , process some 4, 000 case since 1980 . the public perception of amnesty have also change and this have not happen by accident . for a long time deem a white , western	organization	, the setting up of section sin country like tunisia , algeria and south korea , be ample illustration of amnesty 's worldwide stature . as a multi - lingual movement the human right message can be convey via dozen of report , book and audio - visual material to audience from japan to nigeria . amnesty be global in name and nature .

when amnesty international visit yeman in october 1990 to prepare for government talk , they hear report of thousand of yemenis be expell from saudi arabia , some after be torture . the delegate go to the border and spend three day there screen hundred of people and conduct in - depth interview with many of they . the	organization	urgently appeal to the saudi k to stop the torture and bring the plight of the victim to international attention . on several occasion , however , delegate have face obstruction and harassment in carry out they research . an ai mission to argentina in november 1976 , lead by lord avebury , be follow everywhere by twenty plainclothes policeman who question , intimidate and even detain a number of people who they meet .

when you have do research on a country for year , you also get a sense of which group have vested interest or political agenda , who can be trust and who have give we reliable information , say smart . amnesty also have it own check which ensure that all it major report be pass through several level of approval , often up to the secretary general he . it be also ai 's practice to give it material to government before publication for they view and additional information and the	organization	will publish this in it report . i will be delight if government could prive all we report wrong , if that mean that human right be not be violate , smart say . but invariable , even when we have need to correct or update detail in we report , the sad fact remain that the overall portrait of horror have be show to be true and if anything , understate .
true , there be some fragmentation of member on class issue . the occasional independent unionist and independent orange - lodge representative in politics be a feature of politics from 1880 to 1972 . the northern ireland labour party also be the principal	organization	represent protestant trade unionist . but none of this grouping ever come near to threaten the dominance of unionist party organization , much less the solidarity of protestant loyalist , which always appeare total on the issue of incorporation into a unit , independent ireland . it be only with the trouble , from 1968 , that unionist break rank .
but when it come down to concrete moral judgement and commitment , such abstraction will be find interpret in oppose way . religion the roman catholic church retain a unify hierarchical	organization	for the whole of the island with it bishop meet periodically at maynooth . in 1927 , 1929 , 1956 , and 1960 , there be plenary synod and council . since then , the hierarchy have meet very or less three time per year , but usually in secret session .
since then , the hierarchy have meet very or less three time per year , but usually in secret session . in the north , the bishop pursue the irish catholic community 's interest in what could only be call a spirit of pillarization . this be the arrangement in holland whereby various institution such as medium , school , cultural	organizations	, welfare service , and hospital be duplicate , and run by the separate catholic and protestant community . in holland there be even a third or state sector . in ulster a full panoply of institution emerge from the dual pressure of the church 's concern for it people , and the northern state 's discrimination against catholic .
the clerical and lie leadership also experience a third pressure , that of protect the faithful from the proselytizing activity of a number of evangelical protestant mainly among the young . the church obtain a separate school system , fund mainly by the northern ireland government , similar to the system of catholic school in britain . it also set up it own scout	organizations	, club both sport and social , with irish music , irish dance , and irish or gaelic game . this game be and still be much loath by the majority within the northern protestant community . priest continue to act as sponsor of the local catholic nationalist political structure , chair meeting of the party and permitt the political use of the parish hall .
from it domination by the old ascendancy , the orange order in particular come to embrace protestant from all classes and church . in fact , in rural area today , the orange hall have frequently be the only place where protestant of all shade have meet to renow they belief and commitment to ulster protestant loyalism ( harris 1972 : 1625 ) . it be important to note that this	organizations	be internally stratify . that nearer the top , particularly in the black preceptory , the inner sanctum of the society structure , be there because of they moral and religious stand in the local community : wealthy farmer , businessman , good churchman , or at least of know moral probity . they tend to represent the religious as oppose to the rough end of the protestant spiritual spectrum .
what socialism there have be among the catholic nationalist tradition have always tend to be ally to republicanism , especially in the period 1913 to 1930 ( rumpf and hepburn 1977 : 13 ) . the trade union movement be a case in point . the labour movement in ireland be make up of two	organizations	. one of this be james larkin 's irish transport and general worker ' union , the itgwu . it come to have connolly 's support and be on the way to beco thorough nationalist and republican under connolly 's influence .
two year previously , a campaign to write into the irish constitution the exist legislation criminalize abortion have get under way under the name of the pro - life amendment campaign . it be difficult to describe this body accurate . the bulk of it organizer be member of traditional	organizations	of much recent origin devote to the strengthening of catholic morality . have acquire a sufficient number of signature , the campaign submit they referendum proposal , which the government of the day , the fine gael labour coalition under garret fitzgerald which have come into power that year , decide to submit to the populace . the roman catholic bishop support the wording of the referendum and , as the referendum approach , say it be legitimate to oppose the amendment even if one be against abortion , which be in any case still immoral and be the direct take of an innocent life ( irish bishop ' conference statement , quote o 'carroll 1983 ) .
it grow up originally in the southern middle - class suburb of dalkey , county dublin , and around the church of ireland national school there . a dispute with the local rector and manage lead to a group of parent withdraw they support from the school and come together to form the dalkey school project . the	organization	claime membership from all part of the south , and it membership contain education specialist , lawyer , people from the medium , and civil servant , at little one of who know something of the exist channel of power and communication between church and state in the national school system . energy be directe mainly to the primary sector , where , until recently , it be impossible to have anything but a church - sponsore school if it be to be fund by the state . in 1978 , on the basis of they professional knowledge of schooling and civil administration , the organization succeed in obtain the necessary government permission to open in dalkey a multi - denominational school govern principally by the parent , the mode of religious instruction to be determine by they .

to read i and think you understand i and yet not to understand i . only if you do that will you be able to say with confidence that i be wrong , that what i be suggest have not yet come to pass , that there be still time . he word be take up by many who would not have dreame of open any of he much technical works , and he come to be in great demand as a speaker at rally and at the numerous conference and seminar on the death of image organize by the universitie , the churche and the innumerable humanist	organizations	which have mushroom in the immediately preced decade . even tho who have never hear of he mouth he word , repeat they to other as though they have just think of they they , which perhaps they have , for there be sure such a thing as a spirit of the time . but it do not bring an end to the speculation and confusion which be rend the civilized world .

with hindsight it seem that the prevaile structure of police practice will remain as powerful as ever , for at a conference on policing at bristol university ( 1988 ) , the new retired sir kenneth admitt that police culture have defeate many of he attempt to bring a new ethic to the managerial style during he reign as commissioner of the metropoli . anthropology for the police it seem relevant that anthropology be use at this time to contribute to the debate on police , for since the 1964 police act and the preced royal commission which be generate through concern over police practice , the	organization	have hold an increasingly central place in the public imagination . police issue be never long out of the headline ( _ 1977 ) , and this medium obsession have be transmit into a wealth of analys of policing which have mostly be carry out by outside observer . indeed inside account have large consist of bland reminiscence in the style of i great arrest and case and it have be leave to investigative journalism to redress some unacceptable police activity , by call attention to the limit and abuse of police authority , power , and accountability .
in 1979 , james anderton , the christian moralist chief constable of great manchester , descri the great threat to lee and order as stemm from seditionist interested group who do not have the well - be of this country at heart and who mean to undermine democracy ( thompson 1979 : 380 ) . in the light of such a polemic stand , it beg the question whether the revelation of how crime figure be manipulate by the police to sustain institutional beliefs ( see chapter 5 ) could be say to undermine democracy or be classify as sedition . for anderton vehemently reject the idea of any internal evaluation which might explore the morality or philosophie of policing : there be simply no room in the management and	organization	of police operation for vague , academic dissertation ( police review ; 90 , 19 november 1982 : 4684 ) . in he 1977 annual report , sir david mcnee , then commissioner of the metropolitan police , urge that the libertarian should beware . in due course , he successor , sir kenneth newman , echoe this anti - intellectual stance , when he warn insider that policeman must remember that they be practitioner , not crusader ; they be to do , not to righteously philosophise ( police journal 56 , no . 1 ( 1983 ) ) .
such people be radically oppose to the idea of sociologist conduct research on the police and long for a return to a golden age when the proverbial veil of secrecy surround police work . when the research be experiential , carry out by an insider , the publication can prive emotive and will almost certainly be career - problematic for the author . usually policeman know the limit allow by the	organization	and play safe . harry templeton ( 1980 ) , a police officer in north wale , suggest : when you read in police review that an officer have be award an m.a after post - graduate study , it will probably be in a safe subject such as business management .
all totalitarian institution ( in goffman 's phrase ) embody they principle in an inexplicit way , beyond the grasp of consciousness and exhort the essential by an implicit pedagogy , capable of instill a whole cosmology , an ethic , a political philosophy through injunction as insignificant as stand up straight . it be little wonder then that social research be equate with clap trap in police magazine , for they aim to support the beliefs of that who have take on this unconscious cosmology , and for who as bourdieu ( ibid . ) indicate , such challenge would defy the much natural manifestation of submission to the establish order and abolish lateral possibility . in consequence of this acquired system of generative scheme , an imbued belief be implant in the institutional mind which verge on the natural , while huxley 's mutilate man pursue he insider 's reflexivity seek out the lateral possibility , and make gesture against the principle of the	organization	. in do this the anthropologist at home quickly come to understand why he must always stand on the margin of structure . for it be one of the dictum of the discipline of anthropology that it will reveal unwelcome truths :
i be really surprise very do not creak under the pressure . ( fn 6/11/87 , p 15 ) formal control , however , be only one aspect of the labour process in any work	organization	. constable have a definite view about the style of authority they prefer in officer , which be sum up well by the remark that they need to be one of the boy : that be , they should not stand on ceremony and overtly assert they authority . some sergeant conform to this , other do not , but the general resistance from below to the excess of authority , coupl with a relative autonomy in the work place , afford the man and woman in a section the latitude , if they so wish , to ease , use cain 's now familiar term ( 1973 ) , or , to use they word , bluff .
a . lunacharsky underline the grow rift between the educational health of the large town and the benighted countryside , but to no avail . as be so often the case in central - local relationship , poor distribution be often to blame . the nation - wide state publish	organization	, gosizdat , be responsible for the dissemination of official literature of all kind , but the flow of material to the provinc remain very weak even as late as 1923 . only seven of the fifteen large bookstore in moscow take the trouble to send anything out to provincial peasant reading - centre . none of they make a special selection of material suitable for the peasantry , so the few book that be dispatch be often too dry or too expensive .
the sole reference to the peasantry in this laborious instruction be an order to open all rural reading - room in the surround volosti on 7 november . the meaning of the october revolution be then to be explain to anyone who bother to turn up . give the importance of this area of russia in the civil war and the polish campaign , the party 's care for and vigilance over the army do not come as a surprise ; nor do the considerable military presence in 1922 in civilian	organizations	like the hospital and the automobile workshop . the party 's obvious nervousness about railway and other worker and relative neglect of the rural hinterland need a little much explanation . as the year go by the economic sop to the peasantry provide by nep begin to have a relax effect on this class , but industrial unrest throughout russia continue to rise .
however , there be one big kolkhoz consiste of 150 household only 20 verst from roslavl ' that be say to be too well satisfy with it , and so do not welcome visit from the town . the party wish to introduce the shefstvo system in it relation with the kolkhozy . a shef	organization	from the town such as an individual factory would take on the role of cultural and political mentor to some rural group . shefstvo wag intended to be a nation - wide movement , the concrete expression of the much abstract notion of smychka , the theory of town and country alliance as expound original by marx . the ideal be very far from be a reality in 1922 , or indeed throughout nep .
the arrogance of bolshevik - inspire youth towards the patriarchal rural community also transpire from other criticism directe against young visitor . but peasant also complain when what they call doctor come out to inspect they cattle and sanitary arrangement , or when two peasant who have murder they wive have to be hand over to a visit social court ( obshchestvennyi sud ) set up by a shefstvo team . the party 's myopic concentration on the kind of agricultural	organizations	it wish to nurture for the future be also show in the frequent report for 1922 on the fragile co - operative network . this effort prove to be in vain for the many part . by the middle of 1924 the agitprop section of the smolgubkom be openly declare that both shefstvo and smychka be a farce in actuality because they have deteriorate into mass weekend outing to the countryside in search of illicit stills .
here , as so often when one penetrate to particular , the rigid historiographical division ( war communism , nep , the five - year plan year ) crumble . in we survey of the financial arrangement of nep as they apply to the smolensk guberniium , it be not how they be unstable and poorly define from the outset , lead to economic and social tensions at the low level . right from it inception nep carry within it the germ of it own fatal illness , whether one look at it fiscal	organization	or the economic persona ( like this nepmen ) which it soon evoke , or in many case re - awaken . it be true that high - level bolshevik theorist in moscow and petrograd tend to select , filter , and interpret evidence from the locality in the light of they prevail general beliefs , so that they conclusion have little foundation in hard evidence . yet although yakovlev be one of they kind , he factual finding show little sign of conscious or unconscious censorship or exclusion .
when the soviet send the militium to the colony in order to accuse the inmate of robb peasant , makarenko send even it pack . he show the same scant respect for other agent of central power . he opinion of the local komsomol be no doubt coloure by the fact that he own colony be a kind of rival	organization	, but he view broad reflect that of yakovlev on the nikol 's skaium komsomol ; yakovlev be a much disinterested outsider . makarenko wrote : the local young communist be very weak in both number and quality . they be far too interested in girl and vodka , and they have a rather negative influence on the colonist .
they be far too interested in girl and vodka , and they have a rather negative influence on the colonist . soviet historian have subsequently try to cover over this situation . they have write that it be well know that the great soviet pedagogue , a . s . makarenko , succeed in form a genuine soviet collective of charge only after a komsomol	organization	be establish in he colony . in reality , a komsomol political instructor ( with a criminal record ) enter the colony in 1925 , well after makarenko have establish discipline . this komsomol representation apparently play no role in the subsequent administration of the colony .
yet we cannot take foreign accounts at they face value either . political propaganda on the part of the american relief administration , by far the lon foreign source of aid , warp it judgement at the time , and the subsequent polarization of russian - american relation have not improve the objectivity of late scholarly accounts of the famine as see through american eye . even f . nansen , the esteemed norwegian co - ordinator of many other foreign relief	organizations	, could on occasion be carry away by he emotion and give a semi - fictional account of condition in the volga province . calm assessment be hard to come by in the shadow of a tragedy of such proportion . a native russian of genius , l . tolstoy , have be blinded by he feeling in the famine of 18912 when he make mildly inaccurate statement about the tsarist relief administration .
due to wartime condition the peasantry get the same amount of agricultural machinery over the year 191521 that they have be able to buy in a single year prior to the world war . they have suffere in the civil war from requisition by red , white , and green army , and to some extent from the bolshevik - inspired kombedy ( committee of poor peasant ) . as the famine grow , poor co - operation between the soviet authority and foreign relief group , and amongst the foreign	organizations	they , exacerbate the situation . the bad aspect of co - ordination , however , be central - local relation within the soviet hierarchy . we will return to this later , but at this point the course of the famine need to be relate very brief .
condition in the guberniium capital be dire , but they be even bad in the rural hinterland . it be still possible in early 1922 to buy foodstuff in the city market if one have the money . soviet and foreign relief	organizations	have install they with efficiency and be give out free food . the village on the other hand be quite desolate . up to half of the house be boarde up in area that be starve .
at this point we can embark on an investigation of the spatial or horizontal effect of the famine in 1922 . internal movement within the bad - affect area should be look at first . that peasant who continue to own dratch animal have lent they to relief	organizations	at the height of the famine , but by the spring of 1922 they refuse to do this any long , since they now find many profitable use for they . owner of dratch animal have a virtual monopoly oh the transport of grain to the miller , the market , and the local collection - point for the tax in kind . if the tax be pay prompt , a discount be give .
in other way positive help could be give by much fortunate region . indeed m . i . kalinin , the nominal head of famine relief , claime that 70 to 80 per cent of the adult population of russia be active on the hunger front . party , soviet , co - operative , military , educational , and trade - union	organizations	be involve . the latter designate special week for the production or collection of good to be contribute to the aid programme . by february 1922 trade - union lottery be be hold in forty - eight gubernii .
poor control over shipment lead to theave and other misdemeanour . despite internal and foreign suggestion as to how to improve horizontal co - operation , the central authority take no action throughout 1922 . at both guberniium and central level the soviet government establish a liaison system between they own plenipotentiary and all foreign relief	organizations	. it be head by alexander eiduk , a pugnacious character who be a member of the gpu collegium . foreign organizer soon discover that the system seem to be modell on trotsky 's military commissar .
certainly suspect committee member have attempt to go abroad , but the real reason be probably that the committee have serve it purpose by act as a bait to attract foreign relief organization ( the ara draw up an agreement on 20 august ) . alternative the committee could have serve as a scapegoat if pomgol activity have fail completely . since all foreign relief	organizations	deal with pomgol and with eiduk as chief plenipotentiary , subsequent non - russian scholar have tend to over - concentrate on the working of pomgol and it guberniia equivalent . yet pomgol be little much than a conglomerate make up of other relevant state department . the commissariat of agriculture be the key element within pomgol .
gosplan and other central economic organ from 1921 on have accumulate on paper a number of plan for reconstruction which they be now eager to realize . as in the recent past , and as be to be the case with much great frequency after the start of the five - year plan , planner in moscow draw up neat and rather abstract formulation that do not match up closely with local reality and timing . foreign relief	organizations	and subsequent student of they work have tend to exaggerate this dichotomy with regard to the famine , but internal soviet source lend credence to the view that the sudden withdrawal of many kind of domestic relief be premature . in 1922 it be not so easy to predict crop yield as it be today . in that sense the shift in policy contain an element of chance .
this move at little give great financial stability . between 15 october 1922 and 1 august 1923 , for example , it receive 719 ,502 gold rouble from the tax in kind ( it high source of income be 1,344 , 639 rouble from church treasure ) . when in september 1922 the ara discover that the soviet government intended to export grain in considerable quantity , much foreign relief	organizations	join in the hue and cry . the government give a series of reason for it decision , some of they very plausible than other ; but the main aim seem to be to acquire cash or foreign credit for the rehabilitation of it industry . much grain than expect have to be export due to the precipitous fall in the grain price in the middle of the winter of 19223 .
non - russian paper be leave to local military supervision until the end of civil war , and large to they own device throughout 1922 , unless they exhibit blatant defiance of high political directive , as in the case of georgia . this do not necessarily mean that all local party chief in the minority be also lethargic during 1922 . we know from the smolensk archive that the guberniium committee in the winter of 19223 conven meeting of many local	organizations	, compell they member to subscribe to various belorussian and great - russian newspaper . particular stress be lay on subscription to rabochii put ' , the guberniium party and soviet organ . the local peasant press be in a lamentable condition still .
but the task be increasingly beyond they , as social survey show the inability of the welfare service to cope with the specific need of the aged , the disable , and one - parent family . divorce rise steadily , though the real acceleration in the divorce rate be to come after the matrimonial and family proceeding act of 1 984 which allow petition for divorce after only one year of marriage . especially disadvantage be child , who need be dramatically highlight by the child poverty action group and similar	organizations	. the end of the former child allowance and they replacement with tax - free child benefit in 1975 mean an increase in the problem of dependency , with only about half the 750 , 000 one - parent family in 1976 , for instance , able to rely on they income as means of support . an unduly high proportion of such family be black .
compared with many continental and , indeed , american , the british by this crude test be a relatively happy people . they democracy have remain secure . suggestion in 1975 of a military coup by colonel stirling 's non - party , non - class	organization	of apprehensive patriot or general walker 's non - class militia meet with almost universal derision . so , too , do the alarmist outpouring of the national association for freedom , a far - right pressure - group directe by a clutch of ex - army officer and norris mcwhirter , good known as the author of the guinness book of records and apologist for south africa . at the same time , the british be in distinct worry mood .
ramsey make a speech which disconcert the manager of the conference , who think it a bad example of english insularity . the speech lead to a quarrel , soon patch up , with the general secretary visser to hooft . the meet at evanston clinch the sense of scepticism which ramsey feel , not about the ecumenical movement , but about it inflate claim and it mode of	organization	. that scepticism and memory be to be important when he become an archbishop and be expect to be a leader in the organization . still , at evanston , he allow the personal meet to count with hungarian christian oppress in a satellite state , with a black south african who mere by be there seem to make the afrikaaner defence of apartheid incompatible with christianity .
he be clearly attract to rural religious community , such as that at kelham where he he participate or that seventeen - century community of little gidding which he be late to celebrate . yet he see the danger in make this community an ideal , as he turn an anthropological eye on christianity and perceive that such example seem to proffer no solution to industrial urban and suburban existence the way many people live . such a religious patterning of small community reveal a christendom fix at the state of development suitable to a simple agricultural and piscatorial society , and so imperfect suit to the very complicated	organization	of modern society . eliot 's solution of a widespread christian community hierarchically organize , relate both to the state and individual parish and contain intellectual leader , owe much to benda 's notion of clerc , as well as to the anthropologist 's stress on the connection of religion with society . as in after strange gods , he be concern in he conclusion with a return to source , that be with go back to the savage and work forwards towards he solution to the problem of modern industrial life ; again such a movement be present in terms of a familiar encounter .
the attempt to locate libertarian conservatism in the late eighteen or early nineteen century seem implausible . eccleshall appear to be on strong ground when he look to the late nineteen and twenty century for evidence of libertarian conservatism . here he find	organizations	like the liberty and property defence league ( lpdl ) and the british constitutional association ( bca ) , and individual like lord wemyss , herbert spencer , a . v . dicey , and ern benn , all commit to individualism and all find support the political right . eccleshall also find back here from one of the recent history of the late victorian and edwardian conservative party . the work of matthew fforde appear to offer an historical lifeline to that , like eccleshall , who would present thatcherism in term of an established tradition of libertarian conservative think .
if dispute within the party over policy and doctrine be one symptom of conservative confusion , another be the legion of league which appear in the late nineteen and early twenty century , when it seem that hardly a year go by without the founding of some new right - w association . the main aim of franz coetzee 's intrigue study for party or country be to explain this phenomenon through an examination of the outlook and activity of three of the large group : the navy league ( nl ) , the tariff reform league ( trl ) , and the anti - socialist union ( asu ) . in term of the history of this	organizations	as institution coetzee 's work be unlikely to be surpass . he examine they foundation , they fund , they social constituency , and they organizational structure in detail , and in the process dispose of a number of myth and conventional wisdom . for example , cortzee show that contemporary tale of the tariff reform million , be not bear out by the relatively impoverished state of the tariff reform league , and he demonstrate that the variety of industry and economic activity which be represent in the trl defy any attempt to produce a simple definition of it intere base .
he examine they foundation , they fund , they social constituency , and they organizational structure in detail , and in the process dispose of a number of myth and conventional wisdom . for example , cortzee show that contemporary tale of the tariff reform million , be not bear out by the relatively impoverished state of the tariff reform league , and he demonstrate that the variety of industry and economic activity which be represent in the trl defy any attempt to produce a simple definition of it intere base . on issue like this coetzee 's sensitivity and grasp of detail be show to good effect : but with regard to the broad historical significance of this	organizations	he be less assure , and he leave untouch some of the much important question raise by he work . the leitmotif of coetzee 's book , as suggest by he title , be that the organization he have study face an ongoing dilemma : whether to function as adjunct of the conservative party or to claim that they aim be national and therefore above party . in fact , as coetzee demonstrate , the personnel of the trl , the nl , and the asu be predominantly conservative , and in this respect they claim to be non - party be always weak .
first , it cause the group some significant problem . the nl especially suffer a major split because of it refusal after 1906 to endorse conservative candidate . the rival , splinter	organization	which emerge as a result , the imperial maritime league ( iml ) , claim that any serious navalist have to support the conservative , irrespective of the fact that individual liberal candidate be sound on naval question , on the ground that collective the liberals be against and the conservative in favour of a big navy . in the end the nl do become demonstrable pro - conservative and see off the iml challenge , but division like this play they part in ensure that the british navy league be never as large or influential as it german counterpart . the second reason for take the non - party claim serious be that the various league and not just the three study by coetzee be frequently critical of the conservative party and express strong reservation about the effectiveness of the conservative as a political force .
that there should have be a navy league , a tariff reform league , and an anti - socialist union fill with conservative be an indication that there be many conservative supporter who feel that the conservative party be not do it job properly . there be occasion when the league be of great help to the conservative , but they relationship to the party be often ambivalent and sometimes hostile , and it be not always easy to control they activity . it be one of the many strength of coetzee 's work that he recognize the disruptive potential of the new	organizations	, but he conclude that ultimatele they be of benefit to the conservative . it be not just that they help out at the occasional by - election , but that they point to now source of support who eventual accommodation , and to new issue who eventual resolution , would ultimately modify the party it and help equip it for the challenge of post - war politics . as a result of he research into the social constituency of the league , coetzee present they as one of the means whereby the conservative party broaden it support amongst the middle - class and crucial lower - middle - class voter , thus assist it development from a loose conglomeration of agrarian interest to the predominant party of government in urban , industrial britain '
in so far as whitehall have consider this matter it have be vague assume that a status quo ante would be establish and the dutch in the netherlands east indy , the french in indochina , and the colonial office in burma and malaya would resume they rightful sway . the american have different view , but they have deliberately distanc they from the area . only gradually do it daw on that responsible that vigorous and determined nationalist	organizations	have grow up in the shadow of the japanese , that this movement have flourish exceedingly in the vacuum leave by the collapse of japanis power , and that if the colonial regime be to be reconstitute it could only be by force . mountbatten 's personal view be that the new nationalist movement should be appease rather than suppress and that the old colonial power should settle for the good deal that they could get , pledge independence in the near future and thus , he hope , preserve the great part of they economic advantage . in burma , where he have only the british colonial office and colonial administrator to deal with , he be very or less able to have he way .
the problem of service debt be already , in practice , less severe than it be in the early and mid 1980 . relaxation of the international cold war have mean that military intervention by powerful country from either the western or eastern bloc from cuba to france will be much little frequent . even south africa may decide that the return from support such	organizations	as renamo in mozambique be extremely slim . africa will , then , be throw increasingly inward on he , and have increasingly little reason to blame the rest of the world for she problem . this will only be resolve in the course of an internal struggle , which will eventually produce government neither very nor less enlighten than , for instance , that which have rule over western europe for the last five hundred year .
first of all society , as distinct from the state , have to be isolat and analys , and secondly an attempt have to be make at understand the evolution of society , since only then would it be possible to understand under what circumstance the state evolve and what it historical significance be . this be the task first attempt in the german ideology . the first task consist of formulat a view of society which be base on principle different from the traditional one , according to which society could be typify in terms of they administrative	organization	by use such term as democracy or monarchy . if we talk of society in this term , marx argue , we could never appreciate that the phenomena to which the term referr be they only the product of a very fundamental social process . in order to bypass this traditional way of see society , marx turn away from administrative and political organization and try to see society in different , much fundamental terms .
the first task consist of formulat a view of society which be base on principle different from the traditional one , according to which society could be typify in terms of they administrative organization by use such term as democracy or monarchy . if we talk of society in this term , marx argue , we could never appreciate that the phenomena to which the term referr be they only the product of a very fundamental social process . in order to bypass this traditional way of see society , marx turn away from administrative and political	organization	and try to see society in different , much fundamental terms . he argue that society be at bottom a system of organization for produce the good on which people depend for they life . for marx and engel society be to be analys in terms of the social organization of production , which in the german ideology they call the division of labour .
while with the ancient city state there be a unity between town and country , since country settlement be really extension of the city both in the type of economic activity which take place there and in the principle of social organization in the two place , this be not so under feudalism . the difference lead to an important conflict between town and country . at first the freeman of both town and country have an	organization	and a type of property which still retain something of the communal as well as something of the private , but in the town a radical transformation be take place . this transformation be due first to the influx of runaway serf into the town which mean that labourer free from the personal tie of feudalism , but have no access to the means of production , become a dependent and exploitable group which be to become the proletariat . the proletariat be free labourer in the sense that they can sell they labour to whoever will employ they , but be not free to do anything but sell they labour , since they have no access to the means of production : land , tool , workshop , raw material .
this engel do by show that the greek and roman state , the sacred source of the european ideal , be base on principle which can also be see in embryo among much less prestigious people , the american indians . this be deal with in chapter 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 . the third part of engel 's discussion explain why , in spite of the presence of the state in medieval europe , some island of communal	organization	could and do remain . this be explain in terms of the nature of the germanic invasion which bring about the destruction of the roman empire and be deal with in chapter 7 and 8 . the outline of the evolutionary theory of the state in the origin be one we be already familiar with from the early writing of marx and engel , but it be expand here with new information from morgan .
the second part of this second half of the origin deal with greece and rome and in many way again follow what marx and engel have write previously . what be new however be the suggestion , which at the time of write must have appeare as the height of impertinence , that the greek and roman state originate in much the same kind of confederation as the iroquois . in this way engel assert the generality of the principle discuss , but also he explain the importance of what he believe be remain of gentile principle in the	organization	of greece and rome . ( he do admit however that this remain be in historical time at little link to patrilineal group ; rather odd inheritor of the principle of the matrilineal gen . ) two other general point also emerge from the discussion of greece and rome .
( he do admit however that this remain be in historical time at little link to patrilineal group ; rather odd inheritor of the principle of the matrilineal gen . ) two other general point also emerge from the discussion of greece and rome . the first be that it show well the distinction engel make between general principle in this case the dissolution of communal	organization	and the rise of class and specific cas . engel do not pretend that the history of greece , rome , and the iroquois be identical . what he state be that the dame general principle govern they development , although condition be so different that this principle have considerable different effect in the different case .
the communal and the familial be not necessarily in opposition they be matter of level , and although at certain time marx seem to see this , at other he do not and engel never do . this be because of they legitimate keenness to stress the presence of a communal principle in the history of mankind . none the less the fact remain that the presence of descent group tell we nothing directly about domestic	organization	. there be , however , yet another way in which modern anthropologist could agree with marx , engel , and morgan concern the group aspect of marriage . all would stress that we view of marriage as a private alliance concern almost exclusive two people be totally inappropriate for many non - capitalist societies , especially tho base on descent group .
as we see , much modern anthropologist would , like morgan , stress the corporate character of descent group and would agree that this group cannot be understand as large family fortes , 1953 , but they would also stress that some kind of individual domestic unit seem to normal exist in society with descent group . in certain other way morgan misl marx and engel very irredeemable . morgan believe that the only true descent group be matrilineal , and that matrilineal descent group gen be fundamental different in	organization	from system where descent be reckon in the male line . in patrilineal descent group , he argue , the individual family and private property be prominent and the communal principle already moribund . in fact , there seem no difference between patrilineal and matrilineal group in this respect .
in patrilineal descent group , he argue , the individual family and private property be prominent and the communal principle already moribund . in fact , there seem no difference between patrilineal and matrilineal group in this respect . what matter , as morgan , marx , and engel rightly stress , be the corporate	organization	of descent group , but this descent group be just as corporate whether descent be reckon patrilineally or matrilineally . the reason morgan give to explain why corporate descent group be organize matrilineally be that since there be no individual union within such group one could never be sure of the identity of one 's father . this state of gen promiscuity be , however , imaginary and so the reasoning be irrelevant .
the various dayak society of borneo be an example . this great variety than that envisage by morgan or engel do certainly modify the picture . on the whole , however , they idea concern the political	organization	of descent - group society , what they call the gentile constitution , be surprisingly modern and helpful and seem support by very recent finding . the next stage in morgan 's and engel 's scheme for the evolution of political system be characterize by confederation of different tribe . morgan , who engel follow , be once again base he on he study of the iroquois .
she preference be for small charity where she feel she can do some good , and where she have some natural interest . the british deaf association ( bd a ) be another such charity . this have be one of the 150	organizations	that have write ask for patronage when diana become engage , and have be turn down . then , quite out of the blue at the end of 1983 , they have a letter from the palace say that the princess have decide she would like to be they patron . it be no coincidence , perhaps , that it president be the marquess of salisbury , marry to mollie salisbury who have spend so much time help with the garden at highgrove .
she presence be enough to make front - page news . this be also true , of course , of the prince . he may not have attract the camera in quite the way the princess do , but he certainly bring recognition and respectability to every company or	organization	who threshold he cross . the prestige they reape from a visit be incalculable . this be one aspect of he life that charles find hard to come to terms with , especially during this period when he be evaluat and reassesse he role in life .
but in september 1985 he join force with a man who be to play a large part in change all that . stephen o'brien be a remarkable man , like and respect by everyone he come into contact with . he main mission in life for the last ten year , as chief executive of an	organization	call business in the community ( bitc ) , have be to cut unemployment and regenerate the inner city . bitc be a charity , set up in 1981 , to breathe life back into britain 's dy town and city . it be a partnership between business , central and local government and trade union , base on the american experience .
in general . and that include you . the scheme be locally run on a franchise basis , by voluntary	organizations	, school or employer , and the hope be that in the first phase , up to 1993 , 10 , 000 people age between sixteen and twenty - four immediately dub charlie 's army by the press will join full - or part - time programme of about twelve week . the brochure continue : a lot of thing will happen to you during you time with the volunteer . you will become part of a team .
i connections with the city be , as i have say , rather tenuous , but it be nearly six year ago to the day since we wedd , when yet again the traffic in the city be bring to a standstill . since that july day i have visit the city on numerous occasion connect directly or indirect to ask the city for help with fund - raise . perhaps now be an opportunity of thank everyone for they generosity and to say how great i know it be appreciate by the charity and	organizations	concern . be always ready , according to you power to relieve the poor and help the distress be a quote from the rule for the conduct of life , a copy of which be give to all new freemen or perhaps it should now be freeperson . sit in the audience be diana 's father , earl spencer , who have always be very proud of he daughter , and only too happy to tell the world so .
seoul cathedral parish have over 30,000 catholic . only parish over 60, 000 may have a curate . laity participate mainly through traditional	organizations	and the call now be for a new strategy base on small christian community . this year the 44th eucharistic congress will be hold in korea from 5th to 8 october . south korea be know for it ship build .
now she be listen to they kidnapper . what she remember much be he self - disgust and terror . monica ring lawyer at the vicariate of solidarity , which have be set up by the catholic church in 1975 and be by now chile 's lead human right	organization	. the lawyer take valenzuela off to record he testimony . a few day late , valenzuela go underground .
on may 28 , 1971 , angie give birth to duncan zowie haywood bowie , an event that david document by write kook for the hunky dory lp . in august andy warhol 's production of pork opened at the roundhouse in london . the cast of this production would play a major role in the mainman	organization	set up by tony defry to handle david 's career : cherry vanilla would become press agent , jamie andrew an administrator , tony zanetta david 's personal assistant and leee black childer the mainman staff photographer . leee childer : the production be make from andy warhol 's personal tape . he use to tape everything every conversation , every telephone call , everything and we put it together into a play .
the greens have plan to hold they 1989 rally in the sorbonne , but at the last minute they be tell they would have to go elsewhere and the only venue available at short notice be the cit . the hand of president franois mitterrand be detect . euro - election be pend and , it be rumoure , he be do he good to make life miserable for an	organization	which challenge he claim to the green constituency . give the meek a good deal join the greens , announce a poster on a publicity stand in the foyer of the conference hall . the 1000 or so member of the meek class who present they at the conference , be , suitable enough , unruffle by have be shunt from the sorbonne to the techno - chic siding at porte de la villette .
to do that in the way the greens propose would require a virtually totalitarian state , bryan gould ( at the time shadow trade secretary ) tell the shadow cabinet in july 1989 . he admitt , though , that labour be see as too producer - orient : we should be able to give a value to unpollute air , clean water , a safe environment , as the end - product of economic activity . a great many green idea be produce by labour that summer ; a green bill to show up the deficiency in tory legislation ; make the quality of life the central theme in the 1990 local election ; the mobilization of public opinion through the development of a network of environmental , countryside and energy	organizations	. the trades union congress weigh in with a green charter , which include the right to hold green strike over issue like the importation of toxic waste . but by the end of the year the green bill have be quietly drop and the environmental network have vanish into a general belief in the need for good , informal relation with friend of the ear and other environmental organization .
they be almost but not quite on the same side . it could be argue , too , that they be beneficiary of the heighten public awareness create by the increase emphasis by government on the peril face the environment . many waverer must have reach for they chequebook and sign on with a green campaign	organization	after hear the late pronouncement assure they that there really be something to worry about . there be danger in become officially accept . complacency and a tendency to mute criticism of government be among they .
climate change be already very important than acid rain , genetic engineere a much topical issue than save whale . change issue do not necessarily throw organization into an anxious state of transition ; if they be any good , they be always in transition . that certainly apply to the three big international green campaign	organizations	: greenpeace , friend of the earth and the world wide fund for nature . they continue to grow in size and influence and they appear to be still some way from peak . as they grow large , they grow richer , they spend very on research and become very authoritative .
this need to be state clearly because there be a current medium clich that greenpeace be turn it back on such tactics and be become a much bureaucratic , softer version of it early radical self . this be demonstrable untrue ; the number of direct action continue in an upwards spiral . what be true be that , in recent year , such action have be back up by sophisticate political lobby and scientific enquiry that have add strength to the	organization	's dramatic call for change . greenpeace be continue insistence on non - violent tactics , even when face with violence , reflect both it cultural origin and it link with the other great movement for social change in the twenty century . peter melchett , greenpeace 's executive director in london , look at the softness issue from the aspect of whether be tough reduce influence .
i do not think we direct action be a problem reduce we effectiveness . politician may not talk to we public , but they do private . the choice of head for the campaigning	organizations	say a great deal about they membership : solid white middle - class . lord melchett , educat at eton , former labour minister of state for northern ireland , become head of greenpeace at the begin of 1989 , near the begin of the membership boom . at friends of the earth there be ( or be until mid - 1990 , when david gee take over ) he friend , the hon .
royalty be in the van and the british headquarter be in panda house , weyside park , godalm , surrey . the late sir peter scott be the founder , in 1961 ( wwf be the only one of the big three which have british origin ) , and international headquarter be in gland , switzerland , in the same building as the international union for conservation of nature and natural resource ( iucn ) , with which it have close relation ( and which , in turn , be close to unep ) . it bill it as the large private conservation	organization	in the world , with office in twenty - three country and much than one million member . in addition to the giant panda ( it logo ) it have reprieve ( wwf 's word ) the indian tiger and the polar bear , the latter by persuade the five arctic nation to restrict hunt . the african elephant be a notable beneficiary of wwf 's activity in 1989 , with two british lawyer worke on it behalf during the negotiation on the cite agreement on ivory .
by 1989 reserf have slip well down the list and education and public awareness have rise . the much significant change , though , be the appointment of a greenhouse gase and transport campaigner . like the other campaign	organizations	, wwf have realize that the natural world can no long be divide into isolated sector of activity . all be unite by the threat of climate change . save elephant , tiger and term in the twenty century will be a small gain if they habitat be ruin or destroy along with man 's in the twenty - first .
much of the 2 million who belong to the national trust ( one of the fifteen ) do so for the sake of visit the house it preserve , not because it be green . all the same , the grow rate of this group , all broad link by an interest in the countryside and the environment , be evidence of the power build up behind the green movement in the 1980 and 1990 . there be an obvious danger of excessive duplication when broad similar	organizations	conduct broad similar campaign . the rainforest be an obvious example . as fund - raiser they be unparallel .
there be informal network through which we let one another know what we be do and we meet and talk . for instance , greenpeace and friend of the earth have ten people each at a meet recently ( towards the end of 1989 ) to talk about the green bill and other issue . ad hoc alliance of green	organizations	take place from time to time , and at the end of 1988 greenpeace , friend of the earth and the world wide fund for nature jointly throw down a green gauntlet to the government , urg it to turn propaganda about the environment into action . a list of thirty measure range from recycle resource to doubl overseas aid be propose . it make very little impact .
nearly one - third of the citizen of leningrad be say to suffer from disease the upper respiratory tract as a result of atmospheric pollution . on the credit side , it should be say that there be now an acute awareness in the soviet union and the east european country that pollution be a social and political issue and not just something that can be categorize vague as an environmental problem and shove to the debit side of progress . smine have struck in the soviet union over pollution ( in combination with other matter ) and score of green	organizations	have spring up . the large in the soviet union , the social - ecological union , have 200 branch and be avowed political in it approach . poverty rather than indifference be the reason for moscow 's inaction , it seem : it be mikhail gorbachev who in he autumn 1988 un speech in new york propose that the un should set up an emergency centre for the environment .
the historic board of admiralty , army council , and air council be downgrade to become the admiralty , army , and air board . and the whole of the new organization be co - locate in the former air ministry/board of trade building on the south side of whitehall , where it be today . many people feel that the thorneycroft/mountbate reorganization do not go far enough , and that service department should have be abolish and a completely functional	organization	adopt . this would have be unwise . the service need time to grow closer together : it be just not possible to find enough officer with the experience in tri - service co - ordination to go far in 1963 .
similarly , although anything that exist be particular and individual , we can have general idea . on the basis of we idea of particular man , we can form a general idea of man , and by abstract difference from the idea of man , horse , and lion , we can form still very general idea , such as that of animal . the four part of gassendi 's logic have to do with the	organization	of think , or method . in accordance with the traditional scheme , he distinguish method of investigation and discovery from method of teach , and refer to the old notion of analysis and resolution , composition and synthesis . discovery need to be check , of course , so gassendi add the method of judgement or assessment .
give this and various of he example , such as triangle or procession , they seem to be way in which the substance on which they depend may be order , organize , or arrange . a triangle be not a material thing , but a shape which material thing may have , an arrangement into which they can be put . a procession be not a material thing , but a certain	organization	of material thing . locke describe mode as combination of scatter and independent idea which be put together by the mind . he describe they as creature of the understand , unlike substance which be works of nature .
the cpr have be set up by ted heath to advise on long - term policy issue . it first director be lord rothschild and it staff be draw both from the civil service and from outside whitehall . the tank have be continue by the succeed labour government during which they carry out they famous inquiry into the foreign office which propose fundamental change in the	organization	of the diplomatic service , and they be retain by margaret thatcher when she take pow in 1979 . government be not bind by they proposal and past history as when labou throw out the foreign office report be ample proof of this . yet for all that , the charge eager make against we be that the government be set on abolish the national health service and privatize health care .
the health service do not have a monopoly in cleaning , cater and laundry skills in the same way that it do in the skills require to treat sick people . there be private company who specialize in this service and who , incidentally , also have dedicate people worke for they . in february 1983 i announce in the house of commons that health authority should put they ancillary service out to tender to see whether they would get good value from private or in - house	organizations	. six month late , in september , i follow this up with a circular to health authority require they to put they service out to tender . they be not force to use private contractor but they be require to make a judgement on the good value for they health authority .
he do not want to miss a word . not while he could see hank . mrs shakespeare , you be well - know for you investigation into extreme left - w group and terrorist	organizations	. do you know much about free people the tough little face look sudden alert .
marie stope 's book , marry love and wise parenthood may have sell wide in the early 1920 but the main reader be almost certainly the middle class . richard allan soloway 's excellent study of the birth control movement between 1870 and 1930 may well reveal the extent to which this group be concern about the need to spread knowledge about birth control amongst the work classes but , it would seem , in the light of much recent research , that such concern be inappropriate . soloway 's comment that , the birth control group find it difficult to persuade the middle and upper - class membership of the feminist	organizations	that access to the contraceptive method be a genuine problem , seem both ill - founded and unnecessary . indeed , it seem high like that work - class family would have control family size through the old , rather than new , technique . the evidence of the 1949 royal commission on population on the use of birth control technique , recognise to be inadequate on the matter , suggest that only 40 per cent of woman marry between 1910 and 1919 use some form of birth control at some time in they marriage compare with 66 per cent of that marry between 1935 and 1939 .
much full use can be make of the machinery for joint consultation and negotiation between employer and employ . it be much than doubtful whether we have see the full possible development of machinery for joint consultation in particular industry . and practically nothing have be do to establish effective machinery of joint conference between the representative	organizations	entitle to speak for industry as a whole . within a few month , similar statement be be make by the k , stanley baldwin , ramsay macdonald , ern bevin , and a whole host of trade unionist . indeed , ern bevin , speak at a union dinner , maintaine that , if there be a new conception of the object of industry , then there can be create in this country condition which will minimize strike and probably make they non - existent for 25 year .
ross mckibbin and bernard barker feel that the labour party be make determined effort to improve both it national and local organization and that , despite some obvious difficulty , it succeed in do so . mckibbin , in particular , acknowledge the strength and weakness of the new constituency and party organization but stress the overall general improvement which be achieve . to he , however , the overrid development be the increase centralization of party	organization	and the grow predominance of the union . the party could only go as far as the union would allow and they influence be apparent at all level . it be the union organizations in both urban and rural constituency which guarantee continuity and finance : what emerge be informal , often improvised , but remarkable tough .
yet , although britain suffere severe economic depression and rise unemployment , she economic plight be much less mark than that of germany and italy . perhaps for this reason britain experience little in the way of a fascist movement in the 1920 ; only a few small and insignificant fascist group , hostile to the bolsheviks or the jew , emerge at that time . it be not until the 1930 that a much effective fascist	organization	, the british union of fascist ( buf ) , be form under the leadership of oswald mosley , at a time when britain be attempt to deal with the unemployment of between 20 and 23 per cent . when the buf develop it create something of a stir as the various political partie adjust to it presence . there be , indeed , quite a furore over it activity , and particularly at the violence associate with it olympia meet of june 1934 .
neither proposition be necessarily correct . the labour party subsequently achie some measure of socialism under attlee , despite the hostility of capitalism , and the labour party be well inform about the real strength of the fascist challenge . quite right , the labour party do not wish to exaggerate the importance of a fringe political group which it have investigate in a detailed national survey , base upon a circular to the secretary of it constituency	organizations	in 1934 . the labour party be well aware of the limit challenge of british fascism and could discriminate between the threat it pos compare with the much serious threat of european fascism . this survey highlight the fact that there be few centr of fascist support outside london , manchester , birmingham and leed area where there be a significant jewish presence or where mosley exert some personal appeal .
after the conference , the socialist league continue to oppose rearmament , oppose sanction against italy threaten as a result of the italian invasion of abyssinia , and advocate a policy for the labour movement of prepare for the mass resistance to war , by which be mean a general strike . in january 1937 it patch together a new unit front campaign in association with the ilp , the communist , the left book club and tribune , around a programme of defence for the spanish republic , opposition to rearmament by the national government , support for the struggle of the unemployed and the affiliation of the communist party and the ilp to the labour party . the campaign be in defiance of the labour party ban on joint work with the communist and the socialist league be condemn by the party , it member be force to choose between disband the	organization	of expulsion . the socialist league be thus dissolve in may 1937 . the failure of the unit front campaign persuade the left of the anti - fascist movement to reconsider it strategy .
the size and range of the relief activitie undertaken show the strength of public support for the spanish republican government . at the national level there be a national joint council for spanish relief , chair by the duchess of atholl , a conservative mp , though dominate by liberal and labour . this committee act as the co - ordinator for the activity of many other	organizations	, include the spanish medical aid committee , the spain foodship youth committee , the league of nation committee , the peace pledge union , and various local council of action and ad hoc body . much towns have aid spain committe , which collect tin of milk , bar of soap , money for medical aid as well as hold meeting to explain the cause of republican spain . while many of this body be underpin by labour and work - class support it should be recognize that they attract support from across the social and political spectrum .
about 7 million be be spend annually on push the claim of wash powder such as tide , daz , omo and persil , compare with 1.7 million on push the performance of music , opera , ballet , theatre and visual art . now , for the price of it modest subscription , which and it laboratory reveal that the clean power of this rival be practically identical . though they fall far short of the giant - kill exploit of citizen ralph nader in the decade to come , the consumer '	organizations	provide a rally point and the hard evidence to contest the claim of 450 million - worth of advertise a year , rough the same a be spend on school . in other respect american firms bring american technique to bear in the opposite direction . the advertising be american , lead by such firms as j . walter thompson and apply to the product of eight hundred american firm dominat the british consumer thomas hedley ( tide and daz ) , hoover , sing , heinz , kellogg , kraft , gillette , kodak , woolworth , colgate - palmolive , esso and ford to name only the top twelve .
the house committee publish a cumulative index of name and organization and there be the attorney general 's list of about two hundred organization which be consider to have be communist or communist front . this include such subversive body as wartime committee for soviet - american friendship or for russian war relief . two ex - fbi man , vincent hartnett and theodore kirkpatrick , compil a handy compendium in book form of member of this dangerous	organizations	in the communication industry . it be call red channel and a copy be standard equipment for every hollywood producer and every radio , television and madison avenue advertise executive . to be name in red channel be to be unemployable unless you cleare you by make a voluntary appearance before the house committee or mccarthy 's sub - committee as a friendly witness who shop he former friend to prive the sincerity of he repentance .
larry adler be blacklist as a performer throughout the fifty . even as a harmonica player he have to come to england to get work . adler recall : i be list in red channel for be associate with eight	organizations	. the one that count against i much be the anti - fascist refugee committee , which i work for in the late thirty . i be offer a deal by roy cohn .
the much militant protestant see this as a weakness , a lack of will on the part of the government . it be now illegal to be a protestant in a protestant country . the result be periodic clash between the government and	organizations	such as protestant action which insist on the right to march where they wish . porter and paisley be frequently to be find lead such marche and various minister for home affair find they be denounce by loyalist at orange rally . the first free presbyterian involvement in an election be a classically ad hoc and reactive affair .
the city council plan to call it the queen elizabeth bridge but the much assertive protestant want a memorial to lord carson . so angry be ian paisley at the affront to carson 's memory that he increase he tirade of abuse against o 'neill , produce carson 's son to contest the westminster election in march ( promise four protestant unionist in all ) and only withdraw when he realise how devoid of constituency organisation he then be . the rudiment of a constituency	organization	be then provide . as be so often the case in paisley 's career , the crucial step be take by someone other than paisley and then offer to paisley as an opportunity the possibility of which he could appreciate . noel doherty , a committed loyalist , have be a member of paisley 's congregation since 1956 .
it be important to note that it be only the statement of this man and he wife which contain any evidence of paisley 's knowledge of the crime , and the jury determine that they be not trustworthy witness . the view of paisley 's critic be that he be implicate but be clever enough to avoid any direct contact . other maintain that , even if he know nothing of this crime , he be morally responsible in that he have contribute substantially to the general climate which allow member of he	organization	to believe that such act be justify in order to destabilize the government of terence o 'neill . this second charge be impossible to evaluate . while it be certainly the case that paisley be prepare to use militant rhetoric in denouncing o 'neillism , it be also the case that he be a vocal critic of private initiative in vigilantism and of attack on catholic .
in they view , the old party have be do well . it now have member in stormont and increase popular support and , much important , it have a clear protestant identity . in many area , it take the full weight of paisley 's authority , exercise either directly or through loyal supporter such as gordon cooke , then chairman of the north antrim branch , to persuade the protestant unionist to dissolve in favour of the new	organization	. in the event , the failure of large number of official unionist to join mean that the new party be very congenial to the old protestant unionist than they have initially feare . protestant unionist make up about two - third of the new ulster democratic unionist party ( hereafter dup ) .
when the dup be be plan in late 1971 , desmond boal keep push unionist such as austin ardill to join the new party and receive assurance from he and a number of other that they would join . it be only they reluctance to abandon they own party which prevent the creation of a mass anti - appeasement party . at a number of time since , there have be a genuine willingness among some of the dup member of the unite ulster unionist coalition to merge they party into a new wider	organization	. although ian paisley have unfail faith in he own leadership quality a faith that be share by he supporter he be will to work in coalition with the other unionist leader , and the continued division within the unionist camp cannot be lay entire at he door . the second footnote be relate to this point and it concern the career of william beattie .
in order to ensure that the catholic population won at little one of the three seat allocate to northern ireland , the whole of the province be treat as one constituency with three member . the election could hardly have be good design to promote the dup . although robinson and other be achieve success in build a province - wide	organization	, the dup 's great asset be it leader . treat the whole province as a single constituency give paisley a chance to cash in on he considerable personal support . paisley be the sole dup candidate and john hume be the candidate for the sdlp , but the official unionist make the tactical mistake of fielde two candidate .
in order to do this , jerry falwell and the other baptist pastor in the movement have to operate with almost watertight compartment for , on the one hand , they religion ( in this box catholic and jew be doom sinner ) , and on the other , they politics ( we be all part of a share judeo - christian tradition ) . that sort of compartmentalization have be round denounce by bob jone university and that sections of american fundamentalism with which paisley be many at home but we will never know if he religio - political system would permit such pragmatism because the constitutional issue so override everything else in northern ireland that there be no expectation or need for he to work with conservative catholic . this do not mean that paisley would not be glad of the support ( such as he have in he campaign to save ulster from sodomy ) of individual catholic , but he would not work with catholic	organizations	or official of the catholic church because that might dilute he separatist witness . the evangelical and the orange order the only problem of alliance and compartmentalization face by free presbyterian democratic unionist be that which concern the fraternal order .
nevertheless they be considerable very evangelical at the turn of the century than they be now . the problem for the free presbyterian be that the fraternal order have always see they as link the broad protestant religious tradition with the main unionist party , hence the common arrangement of orange lodge hold they annual church parade at each of the church of ireland , presbyterian , and methodist church in turn . as the main church have become much liberal , free presbyterianism emerge to challenge the lack of real protestantism and hence offer an implicit challenge to the fraternal	organizations	to purify they by break they tie with the main , and now apostate , denomination . ian paisley be once a member of the shankill road lodge of the orange order and a lodge chaplain , but he resign from the order when the county grand lodge refuse to expel sir robin kinahan for attend a funeral service in a roman catholic chapel . another free presbyterian minister , austin allen , resign from the order because it would not accept free presbyterian minister as district chaplain .
a third free presbyterian minister say : perhaps the main reason for leave the orange order be that in 1969 i be save by the grace of god and therefore feel that i could not sit and be associate with member of the orange and black while they consume alcohol in they meeting on the 12 and 13th morning each july . give the free presbyterian church 's high political profile one would expect that many of it minister would be active in the orange lodge , black preceptory , and apprentice boy . of forty - four minister who affiliation be know , twenty - one have never be member of any fraternal	organization	. ten have be member of the orange order but nine have resign . three have be member of the independent orange order and one have resign .
three have be member of the independent orange order and one have resign . ten minister be know to be member of the apprentice boy of derry . it would be easy to exaggerate the extent to which the lack of genuine evangelicalism in the fraternal	organizations	create motivational problem for free presbyterian who wish to be active in politics . some district be clearly sympathetic to the democratic unionist and be willing to invite free presbyterian democratic unionist such as william mccrea to preach at they church parade . some have church parade to free presbyterian church .
this be even very the case since the anglo - irish accord of november 1985 which clearly represent the british government 's view that solution to the northern ireland problem require the active involvement of the dublin government . for the dup to embrace this accord and attempt to make it work would be for it to abandon it opposition to anything which presage a unit ireland . it be usually the case that that thing which good suit the michel model be social movement	organizations	which have goal which can be compromise because they be thing like an increase in worker 's standard of living or an improvement in work condition which be divisible . trade unionist could be persuade to accept a moderation of they organization 's state goal in return for the fulfilment of part of that goal . the position and ideology of ulster unionist be such that they goal cannot be divide .

the prisoner have be hold incommunicado for eighteen year . the sentence of many of the military prisoner be complete year ago , but nobody be release . no journalist will risk prison to put an article in the	paper	. according to k hassan ii and he government , the prison do not exist or , even if it do , the people all love the king so much it would be unsafe to release the prisoner they might be kill by the populace . we finish we coffee and watch the seagull whirl and shriek over the harbour in the spr sunshine .
the scope or character of a piece of criticism be naturally relate to the magazine or newspaper in which it appear , as we notice in the case of dore ashton 's dismissal from the new york times because it be assert that she work could not be understand by the paper 's reader . the first rule for a reader of article be thus to find a sympathetic publication . some trial and error should eliminate the laziest	paper	, who critic do no much than pillage catalogue introduction , or even press release . some latitude can be allow to serious critics who write for periodical which go to press a long time before a show be on view ; this critic will not be able to commend on how the exhibition actual look , as they article will have be write before the show 's installation . they nevertheless will have see some , perhaps all the work include , and can thus commend usefully on the artist 's stand , aim and achievement .
choice for subsidy be in they art critical judgement , just as commission be , and public debate can become enflame over commission . the art critic have no decisive voice in such controversy , though argument can be make by analogy from exist art to what may be do . another form of article which can include art criticism be a theoretical	paper	. for example , the cultural theory of the 1970 , according to an article by victor burgin on the end of art theory , draw predominantly on feminism , marxism , psychoanalysis and semiotics . in he view the independence of modernism in art have be far subvert by the demonstration of the necessarily intertextual nature of the production of meaning .
from abyssinia kapuscinski pass to persia . from rassela , as it be , to ozymandia . present in the second book as the occupant of an iranian hotel room sift through he	paper	, photograph and cassette , kapuscinski recite the history of the region , which have thrust the shah of shah into the sand in the posture of the statue of the king of king in shelley 's tyrannophobe poem . the shah have make a showplace of he country with he colossal purchase of weapon , and look what it have all come to : if you drive from shiraz to isfahan even today you will see hundred of helicopter park off to the right of the highway . sand be gradually cover the inert machine .
according to the guardian , the new year 's honour list of 1988 in britain contain a knighthood for professor albert maillard , the oxford historian . two of the several name owne by another recipient have stray into someone 's word - processor to create a further deserve don , the know reference to who must have ruin the new year for much than one senior scholar . i feel that albert maillard , if he exist , would have no time for kapuscinski 's impressionism , for he absence of date , figure and state	paper	, and that albert maillard would be wrong . there be history in the accounts kapuscinski give of the confusion and uncertainty which he have experience and which he have try to interpret . all be not dark in this account , and indeed they can be say to gleam with a quality of reflected light .

you may smile , but do freedom of the press mean freedom to choose it own standard down , as i would have be oblige to do have it not be burn down during the state of emergency which follow independence . but what to put in it place the english millionaire fold he sing tent and stole away the insurance money , which do not belong to he since i have nationalize the	paper	well before the fire be out . material miss from transcription at this point ; cannot correct or quantify , as original not available and book out of print never mind the field be open .

however , the policy be see as ambiguous . that who wish , both unionist and nationalist , can interpret it as the beginning of absorption into an all - ireland state . but that who wish for a basically northern solution , even a dual national state with input both from the republic and britain , can interpret the policy as suit they need , and can thus find space on the ballot	paper	for the sdlp . while in the last century there be still some attempt to embrace all people in ireland as the irish nation , now the nation subsist in the irish catholic population . the ambiguity present in o 'connell have arguable aid catholic nationalist over the year in the justification of they policy .

a girl of twelve turn she face to the wall , refuse all nourishment , and so pass away . other , very robust or little perceptive , find , on the contrary , a renewed zest for life in the perpetual animate discussion occasione by the topic . a distinguished philosopher , much admire in the profession , become a celebrity overnight when he wrote in a sunday	paper	that what all the vary response have in common be the forlorn belief that somehow , through talk or action , the decisive event would be ward off . but , he point out , no one could possible conceive what life would be like after the death of image . without image , he say , there would not even be the wherewithal to talk about the death of image .
he take off he shoe to investigate , then hear a noise overhead and see a flock of starling fly past . became fascinate by the pattern as they wheel and change direction . get out	paper	and pencil to try and think through the implication of what he have just see , then give up and start off home . some time late find he have only one shoe on . go back but the other have go .
not dismiss , wrote harsnet ( type goldberg ) . i mere state the fact . fortunately , he wrote , while every person , very or less , in the western world , have access to pen and	paper	and can write down a word or two , few will turn as naturally to paint or music to soothe they trouble breast . some consolation , he wrote . i loath of terms like depression and despair , he wrote .
as though i have never be . a little fuss at the time cannot be avoid , he wrote , that be obvious . whether i destroy the clothes first or fold they neat the	paper	will have to have they story . but that will soon be forget . only the glass will remain .
i shut the door behind he and lock it . yesterday he come again , with she and pearsall , the head man in edinburgh . i sit in the kitchen and read the	paper	. they be in there for a long time . they come out and she gush .
he be a fan of sexton blake . he be a pain in sergeant bramble 's bottom and the sooner he could recommend that quince be transfer to somewhere much metropolitan , where robbery with violence might occur , the happy bramble would be . dratted nuisance that quince lad ! think bramble , and start to read the	paper	. this he do with difficulty , partly on account of he bad eyesight , partly because of what in late year would come to be refer to as a learn disability or mild dyslexium ; and partly because he simply be not much of a reader . he do not actual have to run he finger along the line in order to make sense of it , but he do like to mouth the word as he get to they .
they be all out to catch henry 's eye . the fancier something look , the good he think it tast . cherry , chocolate , walnut , and anything in silver	paper	henry always want the good of anything and everything . think it be he due . i be glad he be go i can do what i like , now .
simon brett writes : a few year back , i buy an old desk at an auction and , when i get it home , find that the drawer have not be empty by it previous owner . he , from the	paper	i find there , i deduce to have be an academic of some kind . in a miscellaneous pile of documents , i come across the follow essay . it seem to have be submit as part of he doctoral thesis by an american postgraduate student name osbert mint .
let i try to explain what i mean . designer seem to be the buzz adjective of the eighty . it have be the word use to describe the style of today , a style that pervade everything from clothes to waste -	paper	bin . the problem be not so much the look it , but the attitude behind the style that appearance ( and label ) be everything . add together a susceptibility to flashy package and a lack of any real interest in the substance of other people 's problem and you be on the way to produce a design carer , .
that would be very nice . thank you . a couple of	paper	be duly buy and after that we parte company . the bounce be now back in jenny 's step , i notice , as i watch she head off towards the tube . she have evident decide that thing be go to be all right .
never lie crop directly on the floor where it be possible they could suffer from the effect of damp and poor air circulation , and arrange produce according to it preference : the root near to the cool floor , and onion and marrow close to the ceiling where it be slight warm . spud space once dug and leave to dry , potato can be sort and store in teachest , thick	paper	sack or shallow box cover with sack to keep the light from turn they green . while parsnip , maincrop carrot , turnip and swede be often leave in the ground , cover with straw or leaf and dug as need , they be well store in box under cover if the soil be heavy and wet , or if you have a high soil pest population . use any damaged root immediately and leave the rest to dry .
talk with you children why aids be an everyday topic in the	paper	and on television ; there be every chance that you child have become interested , even at a young age , but they may have misunderstood thing and have some strange idea . it be important for you to talk with they about aid , to explain the important fact and to answer any questions they may have . how
a central decision make process involve inspectors and civilian decision maker be establish and develope . it early implementation meet with a degree of resistance , for the new system fundamentally dislocate the well establish and cultural preference of the service . inspectors can no long hide behind a	paper	manage a desk ( quote from a chief superintendent ) . then again for reason of establish cultural preference we have to go back to the audit commission and ask they to translate 6.358 million into real man , for we have difficulty in try to sell such an alien concept to the police mind . in effect they fiscal mandate mean they version of reality fail to synchronize with the police world view .
certainly the social science be see to be the arbiter of revolutionary change which might somehow dismantle the police institution and it process , and this have lead it to negate the reform social scientist , keep they as outsider beyond the system . a far example from the police foundation oxford conference give some indication of the different perspective which exist for the analytic research and the practical policeman : barrie irve , the police foundation director have present a	paper	today outlin research into the police and criminal evidence act ( pace ) . have some 1979 data on custody practice and prison interview he sotch to replicate the study in 1986/7 to assess the influence of the legislation on police practice . claim significant difference in post - pace activity he suggest this show the need for legal measure to impact upon police practice and influence change .
although rare define , it be often on the lip of the member , so that the phrase , i do not want to seem disloyal , but will often preface even the mild internal criticism of any of the system of policing . this total reverence to the group bind idea of silence , loyalty , and reticence together to create a positive category for belief and action and , in turn , link silence to other concept of respect for the order of the institution . in consequence , even the publication of an academic seminar	paper	carry out without formal approval could form a breach in the regulate structure of police existence and be subject to disciplinary control . in such a world , the easy resolution of the ethical dilemma remain problematic , for as anne akeroyd ( 1984 : 134 ) recognize there be not , nor ever likely to be any definitive agreement about the nature of either the problem or solution face the social scientist and the question of ethics . i have never completely resolve i own dilemma , for i do not think it have a simple resolution .
c ) if it be consider imperative that such privilege information should be include on the paper and which sic fall within the term of the concern express above , then the whole should be submit for approval by a chief officer who will give a rule as to it use and circulation . nothing in this order change the already exist practice exercise in connection with cours or paper overseen by the regional inspector train unit or police college . in this case a senior police officer have first read of any	paper	and all other personnel involve have be require to enter into an undertak to respect the security of the information . ( force order w/e 28 november 1987 ) . in effect , such an order intend that all dissertation and paper will be submit for vett .
in this cas a senior police officer have first read of any paper and all other personnel involve have be require to enter into an undertak to respect the security of the information . ( force order w/e 28 november 1987 ) . in effect , such an order intend that all dissertation and	paper	will be submit for vett . any criterium for defi privileged information , or what the danger be in reveal such matter as disposition ( of manpower ) be so vague incorporate as to ensure that few will risk submitt an essay without approval , which might late be assess as an improper disclosure . the creation of this order at the time a new official secrets bill be be push through parliament by an increasingly interventionist government be significant , and the idea of a senior officer 's have first read of any essay to maintain the integrity of the institution manifest the importance of the legalize surveillance of alleged dangerous material and enhance the separation of the world of control from that academic enquiry ; although it implementation be only randomly apply .
webb et al . ( 1966 : 72 ) recognize such unobtrusive measure have find favour in field - work and i discovere at an early stage that the problem remain one of reveal the structural wart of the system while somehow indicate that this need not be seditious ; and indeed might even be of some value . as it be , when i show close colleague i first worke	paper	( young 1979a ) on experience in a police bridewell ( see chapter 2 and 3 ) , they be alarm . i be tell on much than one occasion , that i should not really let outsider see this sort of thing , even though it be agree that what i have write be an accurate analysis of event . in some respect , i think it be the detail of the ethnographic thick description which much alarm they ; for as almost all of they wistfully point out : it show exactly how we do the business .
the staff college should be a place where serve officer have the opportunity to contemplate society as a whole and in particular to study and consider that liberal and humane value which be central to we society . the college should have as it prime concern the nurture of ethics and integrity ; they be the core of any profession . such a proposal be now of another era , however , and i be present when an ex - dean of academic study at the college present a	paper	( stead 1980 ) attack the trend to expensive , amalgamate police unit which have grow up in the previous two decade . the appetite for power this immense force display worry stead , and he argue they style could only lead to an autocratic national system with a minister of central government at the apex . he fear seem to be well founded , for a move toward regionalization be now occurre , with a proposal that the forty - three force disappear into perhaps eight or nine giant regional unit .
we could hose university seminar to which speaker of note could be invite to attend . in this way the association could counter the left w type seminar sic which be often very one sid and misrepresentative of current police view the chairman also suggest that the membership could publish	paper	. this narrow academic proposal for a one - side , right - w debat group be circulate in august 1986 , with options for the future of the association . this be to be consider at the agm on 20 september 1986 when the association would seek to create a blend of social and professional academic pursuit .
he dismissive descri how this man have come in , take the material provide , and then have write a childish and critical book on the police , out of which he get a ph.d . again a metaphorical breach of a sacred boundary have occur and an enemy make a gain at the expense of the integrity of the inside ! it be this logic of practice which effective negate many research and be perhaps the main reason that between 1979 and 1988 , only one of the research	paper	i have compil have be look at by senior officer . neglectful silence be , of course , the much perfect means of maintain the powerful integrity of the institutional boundary against any criticism . during this period i have give reading and seminar paper at various academic centre , include the university of oxford , durham , edinburgh , essex , manchester , lancaster , newcastle , sussex , and east anglia , and have write a number of unpublish paper which i have give in seminar at other similar establishment .
it be this logic of practice which effective negate many research and be perhaps the main reason that between 1979 and 1988 , only one of the research paper i have compil have be look at by senior officer . neglectful silence be , of course , the much perfect means of maintain the powerful integrity of the institutional boundary against any criticism . during this period i have give reading and seminar	paper	which i have give in seminar at other similar establishment . on much than one occasion , i have include a bibliography when submitt a c.v . to i senior command and in 1986 i inform i chief officer of the acceptance of i ph.d .
and even if an uncommissioned but critical ethnography be not consider to be in breach of the official secrets act , it will much likely be construe as structural espionage and lie in breach of the police discipline code as set out in police regulation . any internal disciplinary measure to contain such an account be much less like to become of public concern in the way that the clive ponting or the cathy massiter prosecution become notorious caus clbre . as a result of this all pervad desire for reticence it be possible to suggest that the presentation of research	paper	in seminar , the creation of an undirect thesis , not to mention the production of a book , could easy have place i in breach of regulation 6 , which outline the disciplinary offence of improper disclosure of information , which offence be commit where a member of a police force ( a ) without proper authority communicate to any person , any information which he have in he possession as a member of a police force that i avoid such a course of action be because of i own understand of what the institution would allow before it swing into action .
we list contain the name of the family prig we know be professional thief and burglar ; and of who i be advise on i arrival in the department by an old detective : you only get one chance a year to nail this bastard if you be lucky , so when you do , it get to be watertight . again the litism in the department be large symbolic , for although detective talk continuously of they special knowledge of the world of prig , and despise the uniform branch as wolly , often it be the uniform poli who respond to a call and effect the capture , after which the detective move in to squeeze he dry . the detective have therefore move away from the central important activity of seize the villain into a manipulate world where the	paper	exercise of statistical detection be use to assuage politician , the medium , and a public obsess with the moral panic of increase crime rate . furthermore , the detective be no long in that basic symbol of police identity the uniform . they be less constrain and have much individuality in they civvy clothes , although there be strict , but unwrite rule about what be acceptable dress ( sombre suit and tie ) and what be disordere and undisciplin ( jean , t - shirts , train shoe , and the like ) .
we be now a multiple reality and we structural ambivalence can be illustrate by one example when one of the squad create a blazer badge in heraldic style ( although we could never have be see in a blazer at this time when faded denim be the order of the day ) . this badge have cross hypodermic syringe and a latin motto which when translate , read : body in the cell , name in the paper . the blazer badge reinforce the capture of body philosophy which have sustain we early life , but be create at the same time that i be compil a	paper	for presentation at the national bma police surgeon 's conference . i believe they come to hear jolly conference storie about drug fiend and acid head , but the paper conclud : it would seem that the economic of the socially appro tobacco and alcohol industry mean that we have to accept 42 , 000 deaths annually from cigarette , and the cost to society of 50, 000 alcoholic .

that be sexual inequality ! she make a huge pot of strong coffee . push book and	paper	into pile , throw discard clothes into the bedroom . sudden the door bell ring and she bless that she will bliss the afternoon away . she will give much time to think about lucy than anything else for month .
tide and tear have fade and roughen every strand . she bedroom have become a nest . a crow 's nest high above the street , a magpie 's nest , phone light fire scad of book juice vitamin pill cold tea tobacco	paper	match ashtray diary address book radio all within reach of the heap of pillow and quilt , tangle sheet and he . jay have take up situationist sculpture , and ease he half upright to look at yesterday evening 's achievement . ah yes !
the woman 's room be bare as jay 's . so jay drift next door for she dreg of brandy . and the woman who name , it happen , be aurora whitter on about an infidelity perform against she by a title husband , an imminent divorce , a sunday	paper	scandal . mm , say jay , immerse in mozart . none of which have any relevance to you , say the woman , but it be nice and polite of you to listen .
he say at last , so what plan have come out of all this buzze and swarm it will suit you , angus , stewart say , laugh and unabash . they have do they homework too they have it down on	paper	. a letter for the duke of atholl . say what
he shoulder towards they and ask , what be go on donald mcculloch be jubilant . oh , three of the duke 's booby from blair castle come rid up with bit of	paper	some rubbish about the act . so the lad here knock they from they horse , and strip off they breech jean bruce giggle and he pause to cuddle she and kiss she cheek and send they back to atholl . they hors be in the park three good one , too .
who can tell they be in english , donald say contemptuously . beside the cross one of the man have tear a	paper	into little bit and scatter they , to a groan catcall from the crowd . the other man shake he head , hold up he paper , and shout out , can anybody read this give i a look at it , cameron shout back .
he scan it it be little much than a text of the act . he remind he of the detail and exult as he see what he could do with it . here be a polite letter from the duke of atholl , he say loud , wave the	paper	. and you know he rare bother to address we . but now he want we young man , so he be gracious .
we talk to he only do you agree and we keep he prisoner here till he sign . have you the	paper	menzy feel in he pocket . yes , it be safe . , the low thick door have swing open .
what will i write with or on the man be bridle at be treat like a minion . i have	paper	here properly stamp . i suppose there be pen in the castle . they be bring and cameron dictate slowly , cheer punctuat he sentence .
donald mcculloch be grin to he friend . it be a poor thing , he call out , when minister turn recruit sergeant ! macdiarmid take the quill and sign , he face like a	paper	mask . the grandtully piper , sense the climax of the gathering , have fill he bag and set . off on a steady march tune .
the factor jump back . mcculloch laugh and turn away . cameron fold the	paper	and give it to james menzy . let we meet outside the gate , he say , and draw up the day 's work . and take a vote on it
but other thing matter very . another castle to be storm . for the sake of a scrap of	paper	. he sude lapse of morale take he by surprise , like a qualm in he stomach . no food since broth and bread last night .
james bow ironically and offer they the document ; alexander menzy pretend to think about it for a full five minute and sign it with extraordinary flourish that make the pen splutter and seem to say , very well , i will humou you ridiculous ritual . james be remember the young man now , william , the laird 's son , a surgeon in the army ; here be trouble . the young man scan the	paper	, hold it out , and as james 's finger reach for it , drop it , eye he , and say in a carry voice , i see you be mad , but do even a lunatic suppose that one of he majesty 's officer would bind he to oppose the law and refrain from arrest criminal they go for he then , alexander and donald mclaggan , the duke 's two son , drag he from he father 's side so that he head bounce on the step , lift he bleed , like forester keep a dy deer clear of the hound , and start to carry he down to the river just to cool he off but cameron run and grip donald 's shoulder and shoute , if you injure an officer it be treason on top of sedition , so they carry he back and lay he careful at he father 's foot . cameron be think ahead now .
they might have become becalm there as they head balloon with the drink but the duke tell he piper to rouse they foot with a steady march , murdo mackenzie of torridon , and they heade off downstream towards grandtully past the stand stone , the quiet watch , while damp black shadow mass in the river - channel as though the night come from there . on the far bank cameron have outstrip they , he army move steadily down the strath , winn signature at the house of cluny , at clochfoldich and pitnacree , by the solid slow avalanche of they number , mass quietly round each house , hammer three time on each door . by this time every gentleman know what be expect of he : cameron never dismount , he lean from the saddle and pass the	paper	down to the angry , helpless proprietor and take it back sign . the west window of hope steuart 's place at ballechin flare with sunset , as though fir blaze inside it . cameron pass it by , the man could stow in he choler for a while , and when the dark come on and he servant and womenfolk grue at every owl - call or salmon - splash from the river , he defiance would burn low and he would give he name .
hope steuart have lean two loaded musket against the doorjamb ; he turn to pick one up but the duke 's two son be on he , twist he arm behind he . he struggle and roar out , i see you , james menzy , i charge you with sedition , and the duke roar back , we charge you with tyranny , trail he round the house , lad , show he servant who be the master now . they cart he like a scarecrow , he heel score the gravel , but he be as stubborn as a pig in a cart , he would never squeal without a hard prod ; donald stewart the blacksmith have to grip he wrist to make he sign the	paper	. the building donald mcculloch come back from the reel of ballechin ' long after he mother , and when he get up at last next morning , the cold porridge have be throw out to the hen .
what do you say the marriage be the man and the woman wedd each other , that be the common law we all believe in . what do the minister do but add the mumbo - jumbo and the bit of	paper	that be right , of course it be . but why pick on i
but at little they wit would have clear again in time for sunday 's meeting and the next milestone in the struggle . the speech if they manage to exact a sworn and write abrogation of the act from every single proprietor in the strath ( and over into tummel and down past dunkeld ) , at little they would have build a	paper	wall round they . much than that how keep the gentry to it
do you think it be enough nothing be enough , so long as we have no hand in government . we be putte	paper	chain on they arm ; they can break they with a gesture . they stop and look at each other and james laugh . we be talk we into a fine slough !
we be within the constitution as it stand , nothing illegal be go on and we claim the right to be treat as democratic citizen assembl as we be free to do . we carry no weapon , the gun be all in taymouth castle , but if they threaten we or fire on we ( behind the yew the minister listen hard than ever ) , then we will reply in kind . now , can everybody see a	paper	james alastair iain donald angus hold they up . there be we argument i believe we can muster sixteen thousand name they must listen to that .
i know there be hay to cut and turn , but it be the harvest that will suffer if we let the act stand . so come to fortingall , to the green , at noon . now can everybody reach a	paper	in the midst of the crowd a huddle of man and woman be use a flat - top gravestone as a table . the point of the quill break through the paper where it lie over an incised letter and a woman in the group push the man with the pen and crowe out , donal , you great fool the king will never read that now !

why necessarily one why this preoccupation with death ( if such a word be allowable on the evidence of but one piece ) there must have be several dozen possible suggestion for an essay from that	paper	political , industrial , military ( the korean war be still ongo ) , in sport or art , etc . etc . he choose death and bereavement ! on which he make two statement : first , that we be unmove by it ; second , that it be a tragedy , especially to the eight - year - old son .
( there have be no plan to illustrate the book , but leonard talk he friend and fellow - student freda guttman into it , and so the book appear with five design from she hand ) . professor dudek have envisage the series come out in paper cover ( the format that be just become the way to the mass market ) ; leonard ensure that it go into hard ; dudek have not mean the book to be prestigious in format but vehicle of introduction ; leonard see to it that he book could stand alongside the good that there be from both side of the atlantic . and he he cover the entire cost ( of 300 ) , and do many of the distribution and sell ( on the campus , in the local caf , in bookstore and so on , aid by a mini - advertise campaign in the mcgill	paper	) . in fact , within a month it have sell out a unique feat for such a volume . he have clearly learn a thing or two from he family 's entrepreneurship , and be not will to be confin to any form of anonymity such as overtook some would - be poet .
we be not all as bad as we be paint . so i spend i first month as special project officer look for work . i read all through the	paper	drop into i in - tray mark for information only . i spot a critical piece about i department in the economist and draft a letter to the editor for mellowe to send but he do not use it . one morning i receive a report on the term of reference for the service - wide performance review and wrote a minute to it author stresse the need to define the concept of work .

a title : paper people , which survive as a phrase in shatov 's mouth , toss up twice by the polemical flood . a paper person be a walk theory , and one which may not even believe in it ; and then the paper person will not mere have nobody , he will have no theory to be . he belong to a	paper	society which go through the motion of life , in the air , notionally . many a reader of the possessed will have smile at von lemke 's paper cut - outs the conductor wave he baton , the bustle railway porter , the hell - fire gesticulate preacher and at the same time he will have wonder why the microcosmic animate toy feel so supremely right for this novel . shatov direct he paper - person thrust against he too .

peter try to rouse he countryman from they aboriginal stupor and turn they into european ; but a russian be not and can not be a german or a frenchman , and the result of peter 's effort be to produce an educated class who can not be russian either . they can of course call they slavophil , but that be to try and wish away peter , to perform an act of mental regression , not to be a russian . it be a	paper	situation , inflammable and precarious . the dangerous consequence of peter be much canvass in the notebook : the social unsteadiness ( shatose ) , as shatov say . thus the cappy man have become the shaky man , the waverer .
the novel articulate the loose end as boredom , again transpersonalize . i find it strange look at you all , say marya lebyadkin , the craze visionary cripple , the fool - in - christ ( yurodivaya ) , in a touchstone meditation ; i do not understand how it be people be bore . unite boredom , provinciality , the gadarene stampede , and	paper	with something write on it . this boredom rotate upon a frivolous - menace , frenetic - slack , comic - terrible axis which be the book 's live principle . in it the dim complacency of gossip and card at we club would seem harmless , familiar , mere social ; but in it denature the possessed where grouping dissolve or collapse into each other , and where the mere social have no place .
francis thomson , the man who for nearly twenty year have be promise to write a biography of alan blumlein be once again appeal for much material on blumlein . thomson 's late letter to the medium very , but in some he explain the decade of delay with a puzzling tale of he attempt to shield the blumlein from the belate discovery that a person close to they have supply i with letter stol from the late mr a k van warrington . as before , thomson , who have also put out call for biographical material on other subject , include s g brown , sign he a member of the institution of electrical engineer , help establish credibility with editor unaware of the fact that he start collect original	paper	in 1972 . but he have publish nothing , refuse third party access to he collection and will not catalogue what he have . although some editor have treat the biographer 's late call with suspicion and either ignore he request or publish it with qualification ( eg hi - fi new , other have simply regurgitate thomson 's plea for letter , note and photograph .
the total number of turn need not be exact but will be around 170 . the next stage be to find a piece of plastic or card tube which will just slide snugly over the wound coil to provide the former for the pickup coil . it be possible to make up a tube by wind and glue layer of brown	paper	round a suitable former . shallow slot should be cut or fil into the top and bottom of the tube as show in fig . 13 . this be to facilitate the winding of the pickup coil .
draw exchange format ( dxf ) : this originate from autocad . it be in widespread use , and be support by other cad system . a glance at a short section of a dxf file , see fig . 2 , might lead to the conclusion that whoever design the format either have share in a	paper	manufactur company , or a grudge against rain forest . a print dxf file be quickly recognisable by consiste mainly of a narrow strip of short line down the left hand margin of each page , usually a large number of page , and a great deal of white paper . it need to be remember that the format be not primarily design for print on paper ; this be just a handy feature .

this too would retain it pre - eminent position as an insulator until replace around 1933 by polyethylene develop by ic i . thomson 's siphon recorder an operation , a move coil d'arsonval galvanometer connect to the line be arrange so that coil deflection , bring about by an incom signal , control movement of a write head across a moving	paper	tape . the tape be drive by either an electric or clockwork motor and the write head be supply with ink from a reservoir by siphon action , as the tape be be drive . write head deflection be proportional to the receive signal current , and so the graph produce indicate magnitude of the line current .
the siphon recorder , adapt by lord kelvin from the gauss/weber mirror galvanometer . write head s be attach to lightweight plate p , which be axially support by wire w . plate p be capable of angular rotation about axis w , control by the silk fibre x and y which be attach to oppose corner of the galvanometer coil . coil movements produce angular movement of p , caus horizontal movement of the write head over	paper	tape t . one end of w be rapid but delicately electrically vibrate allow the write head to make equally rapid , if intermittent , contact with the paper . it also reduce friction at the point of contact .

if so , i be not abash . contemporary intellectual history be an element in i present enterprise , though the very recent past be hard to see clearly . i move towards the conclusion of this chapter by invok a further term in the sequence of title quote above : a recent	paper	by david lodge call after bakhtin . bakhtin be a latecomer on the anglophone critical scene . he major work be do in russia in the 1930 and 1940 , he suffer stalinist repression , be partly rehabilitate , and dy in 1975 , at a time when very few people in the west have hear of he .
norre virtually admit as much from time to time . discuss of grammatology , he say he will treat it as a book with a theme , even though derrida want to discourage such an approach to it . derrida be famous	paper	structure , sign and play arouse much excitement when it be deliver at a conference on structuralism at john hopkin in 1966 , and have since acquire a mythological significance as the fountainhead of american deconstruction . in so far as that essay give some warrant to the idea of free - for - all hermeneutics , then , concede norris , structure , sign and play 's be a text which , at little in it close paragraph , fall below the high standard of derridean argumentative rigour . despite this occasional reservation , norris write as a disciple , who believe that other disciple , as well as derrida 's enemy , have get he wrong .
there be the further consideration that university may not indefinitely be secure haven for literary criticism , in the cold economic climate and rampant anti - intellectualism of thatcherite britain , and of many other part of the world . when english be establish in british university criticism play at well a minor part in it . there be a critical	paper	in the oxford degree , but the emphasis be substantially on scholarship of a tough traditional kind , without much concession to the arnoldian free play of mind . for a long time oxford english be directe towards scholarship and be suspicious of criticism , and this attitude be reflect in it house orgin , the review of english study . helen gardner , for many year an oxford luminary , do not believe that the purpose of english be to turn out critic , any much than it be to produce poet and novelist .
until recently , egraduat teaching be a very marginal activity . in the unite states the graduate school be the major arena of pedagogic activity and intellectual life . it be here that research	paper	be generate and read and discuss , and where the academic superstar go through they pac and inspire they dedicate student . as early as 1921 , the newbolt report , summarize the evidence of professor ernest de slincourt , express deep unease about the american approach to literary research : many of the elaborate these on english literature produce by american student for they doctorate , and afterwards publish , be monument of misdirect effort ; in short , a true sense of literature as a live thing be lose , and in it place be substitute an investigation after the bad pattern of german research , deaden alike to that who wrote and that who read it .
the task of the academic be to teach and engage in research , and , if require , to take on administrative duty . although there be parity of esteem among academic subject , and dog be careful not to eat dog , at little in public , a scientific model of knowledge ha , i believe , come to dominate the modern academy , and to affect attitudes to and within humanistic learning . such knowledge be progressive , render early version of it obsolete , and it circulate quickly and visible through the accept professional channel , like journal and conference -	paper	. it be also subject to quantifiable assessment , in term of volume of publication , frequency of citation , amount of research fund , and the calibre of referee . in english study this be the world of morris zapp , not of phillip swallow .
when we turn from the rock - drill canto to the classic anthology , something be lose but much be gain . and the classic anthology show , therefore , that william be in the right when , to close he sour and justifiable contemptuous statement of 1945 , he wrote : when they lock the man up with jim and john and henry and mary and dolore and grace i hope they will give he access to book , with	paper	enough for he to go on make translation for we from the classics such as we have never see except at he hand in we language . first publish by oxford university press ( new york ) , 1964 . the valley be thick with leaf , with leaf , the tree ,

something have certainly go wrong go soft and mawkish with the english tradition of the amateur , when we find hewlett on face page of binyon 's volume of letter , write in 1916 to e.v . luca , my dear lad , that will be jolly indeed , and to j.c . squire , dear squire , i be very glad to have you quire of poetry which be in jolly type and on jolly	paper	. it be not thus , one cannot help feel , that the serious artist address a fellow practitioner . and even before the war , though hewlett in correspondence with harold monro and newbolt could give and take hard knock by way of semi - technical criticism , yet it be envelop and emasculate by similarly anxious camaraderie .
olson save i life . thus pound in january 1946 , in he first day at st elizabeth 's , appeal in terror at the prospect of lose whatever sanity remain to he . how that life be save live can now know , thanks to catherine seelye who have put the story together , mostly out of olson 's posthumous	paper	at the university of connecticut . she tact and scrupulousness be beyond praise , and the book she have make cannot be recommende too urgently even ( perhaps especially ) to that who have no special interest in , or like for , either charles olson or ezra pound . what to do in a democratic society with the errant or aberrant citizen of genius this question , fumble at or gloss over by everyone who have write on pound 's case ( jurist and psychiatrist , as well as biographer and critic ) , be here pos very starkly , and explore very searchingly , then ever before .
by david frank yesterday be the last day for comments from the public on a paper issue in january entitle : comparability of financial statement publish by the international accounting standard committee . this be hardly the sort of catchy title guarantee to get many of we rush to we desk in search of pen and	paper	, nor be it easy to imagine squeezing into pack village hall to listen to speech demande a rewrite of the rule on defer taxation . in acknowledgement of this , iasc , which comprise the lead world accounte bodies , send out a separate invitation to interest party ask for they view on the subject . it call this : towards the international harmonisation of financial statement .

both bbc viewer and that who do not watch the bbc be agree on balance that it be biase towards the conservative though that who actual watch it be very even divide on the direction of bbc bias than that who do not ( table 6.1 again ) . ( for corroborative figure see iba , 1987 , p 17 . ) in sharp contrast , three quarter of all newspaper reader say that the	paper	give bias coverage of the alliance . ( for early finding on public perception of press bias see kellner and worcester , 1982 ; butler and stokes , 1969 . ) the direction of bias vary from paper to paper .
in sharp contrast , three quarter of all newspaper reader say that the paper they have read on the day of the interview be biase in they coverage of the conservative and labour party , though less than half say they paper give bias coverage of the alliance . ( for early finding on public perception of press bias see kellner and worcester , 1982 ; butler and stokes , 1969 . ) the direction of bias vary from	paper	. rough four - fifth of sun , express , mail , and telegraph reader say they paper be biase towards the conservative , while a similar number of mirror reader say they paper be biase against the conservative . somewhat few reader of the star and the guardian see a conservative versus labour bias in they paper though , on balance , they think the star be pro - conservative and the guardian anti - conservative .

conversely tho who read left - w paper be large agree that they be anti - conservative and pro - labour but very divide on whether they have an anti - alliance bias . perception of both total and net bias increase during the campaign . reader of right - w	paper	become very aware of they anti - conservative , pro - labour bias ( table 6.3 ) . age , education , ideology , even streng of partisanship , have little influence over whether or not people perceive bias on television or in they paper . detection of bias be also unrelat to motivation for follow the campaign or inter in politics during the campaign .
people tend to see television as biase against they own party while they think they paper be biase towards they own party . they assert , rather than deny , the bias in they own prefer paper . no doubt they choose they	paper	part with that bias in mind . the correlation between be conservative and allege anti - conservative bias on the bbc rose from 24 per cent in the first fortnight of the campaign to 32 per cent in the second .
but on hel they decide how to vote , opinion be much very evenly divide : 36 per cent prefer television , 24 per cent the press , and a remarkable 40 per cent say the two source be equally useful ( table 6.12 ) . for provide issue - information , persistent reader of the sun or star prefer television to the press by 67 per cent to 12 per cent : a majority of 55 per cent . sun/star reader 's preference for television as a source of issue - information be just as great as that of people who do not read any	paper	regularly . next come mirror reader , who prefer television to the press by a majority of 35 per cent , and express/mail reader , who prefer television by a majority of 25 per cent . telegraph/time reader be very ambivalent , however , and we small sample of guardian reader prefer the press by a big majority .
why do people get into drug it look cool there be a	party	. stuff be get pass round . it can seem hard to say no !
but they be a reality which naipaul treat in such a way that they , too , can at time seem phantasmagorical . everywhere , transistor give off the reggae beat , make the place a party that never stop , and that might catch fire . a sense of mystery and futility be impart by event at the grange and on the ridge , and that sense be heighten by what take place in the city when the	party	catch fire and rio break out . politician rush to the airport with they loot . then american military helicopter drift about the sky : a show of strength which be mean to secure american interest on the island , to make it safe for the bauxite investment .
but what be much strike about both book be the sense they give of how desolate and enclose an adolescence could be , at opposite end of the society . the good thing presume to be in store for glasser when he go off as a scholarship boy to a glamorous university in the south of england be , in a sense , the subject of gorbal boy at oxford , he second volume of autobiography . the refugee from glasgow see through , and stand up to , some famous middle - class progressive , be ask to spy on student communist , be ask , by a girl at a	party	, to do something ! julian 's get a knife . at another party , in the south of france , a reefer be place between he lip by a girl who trouser fall down .
similarly , the de facto existence of the protestant enclave in the north and it pursuit of protestant dominance in that state may have even reinforce a similar , though integralist , approach in the south . with independence the irish free state develope a type of political party organization on modern line , but without the genuinely class - base politics one find in other european country . the	party	enter politics in 1930 . however , both side develop a centralize party organization , with politician follow the party line . the protestant loyalist state
with independence the irish free state develop a type of political party organization on modern line , but without the genuinely class - base politics one find in other european country . the party structure follow be base on the irish civil war antagonism of 19223 , with the pro - treaty party very or less in power until the anti - treaty party enter politics in 1930 . however , both side develop a centralize	party	line . the protestant loyalist state the condition of the northern catholic nationalist minority have be very different from that of the majority in the south .
the majority of the roman catholic remnan in the north still believe in a unit ireland . they demonstrate this partially by they support for the two nationalist party , sinn fein and the social democratic and labour party , though support for the latter do not necessarily imply nationalism . despite the official socialist tendency of this two	party	, a substantial number of they voter do not appear to question the maintenance of a capitalist - type class structure in a new ireland . the worker ' party still fail to command many vote in election north or south of the border . the provisional movement be divide on the issue of capitalism but , for the time at little , have an openly declare policy of achieve an island - wide socialist republic by the combined means of violence and the democratic process .
the worker ' party still fail to command many vote in election north or south of the border . the provisional movement be divide on the issue of capitalism but , for the time at little , have an openly declare policy of achieve an island - wide socialist republic by the combined means of violence and the democratic process . the sdlp , still the main	party	of catholic nationalist in ulster , have drop much of it socialist platform and maintain a delicate balance between nationalism and pragmatism in it politics . despite frequently hear voice to the contrary , total catholic nationalist domination would be the likely outcome of a unit ireland unless a confederal structure be implement . this be partly because of the structure of catholic nationalism in the southern state and partly because the national unity sotch by significant number of northern catholic nationalist be still on the basis of the reversal of protestant loyalist hegemony rather than a pow compromise .
but none of this grouping ever come near to threaten the dominance of unionist party organization , much less the solidarity of protestant loyalist , which always appeare total on the issue of incorporation into a unit , independent ireland . it be only with the trouble , from 1968 , that unionist break rank . yet , despite the splinter , they have succeed in ally the present two main	party	against the anglo - irish agreement of 1985 . the alliance party of northern ireland , form at the time of the abolition of the stormont parliament , represent that catholic , protestant , and other who disavow the twin alliance of ireland but retain at little a practical attitude on sovereignty . they prefer british to irish rule and seem unlikely to move from that position .
the alliance party of northern ireland , form at the time of the abolition of the stormont parliament , represent that catholic , protestant , and other who disavow the twin alliance of ireland but retain at little a practical attitude on sovereignty . they prefer british to irish rule and seem unlikely to move from that position . while the	party	contain many who active seek peace and reconciliation , it would be wrong to think of they in any sense as overcom the basic conflictual component of bloc power in ireland . castle catholic , that who find a place in the stormont administration and develop a stake in the union , have also vote alliance , but be probably now , in 1989 , switch they allegiance to the newly find conservative associations , which be seek to bring british party loyalty to ulster . the northern ireland statelet be founded on an alliance between the protestant loyalist of ulster and british imperial and capital interest , particularly as represent by the conservative party .
it also set up it own scout organization , club both sport and social , with irish music , irish dance , and irish or gaelic game . this game be and still be much loath by the majority within the northern protestant community . priest continue to act as sponsor of the local catholic nationalist political structure , chair meeting of the	party	and permitt the political use of the parish hall . the parish structure and school become the heart of the northern catholic nationalist community , render culture , politics , and religious identity as interchangeable for member of the in - group . employment pattern , which follow the route of enforce segregation in favour of protestant for they control the great part of the job market and especially the major industrial enterprise and the entire government sector of civil servant and police be even reinforce by the system of job reference provide by the parish priest and catholic notable .
condition by church canon law , participation by clerics in politics be forbide . but at the same time , an enormous sense of responsibility to protect the church , the family , and the mind and heart of the faithful from incursion by the state be perceive to be the basic duty of the church leader . the leadership of the state know in large measure what be want : it be part of the national popular consciousness as well as be it a result of the convention between church and irish parliamentary	party	in the previous century . what have be convention become part of the natural , common - sense universe of catholic nationalist ideology . no real consultation would have be necessary on that score .
we aim to show in chapter 5 that this blindness be in part promote by the religious element in they beliefs . secondly , there be the problem of the northern catholic community , which tend to be take as a monolithic nationalist community . apart from the fact that there have be significant support for the alliance	party	over the last dozen year or so among the catholic middle class , there be also a further factor . rose 's ( 1971 ) survey , conduct in 1968 on the verge of the trouble , find that as many as 30 per cent of the catholic population be explicitly prepare to endorse the constitution of northern ireland , which then include the stormont parliament . catholic , however , do not vote for the unionist party .
this indicate an acceptance of the state structure , or a recognition of a need for the separation of northern ireland from the remain state structure of ireland , but at the same time a continuing opposition to protestan loyalist dominance . one can also add that there be something in the present policy of the sdlp which suggest a need to maintain a somewhat fragile unity in respect of the national question . seamus mallon , mp of the sdlp may have see the hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a unit ireland , but some of he co - politician in the	party	would not share that view . perhaps one should note the care with which the present leader of the party , john hume , choose he word over the future of the north . he be careful not to promote the theme of reunification , but talk of discovere a new way , set up structure of co - operation in the north between the two northern communitie , with the support of the southern government .
the truth of the matter probably lie somewhere in between . as miller argue , there be a long tradition among the protestant of ulster of view the british state ambiguously . it be clear that in the past many of they have consider loyalty to be a two - way process , a contract or covenant , and that the state could be a traitorous	party	as well as the people . the tradition prove of crucial importance in form the basis for the strategy of the alliance from 1911 until british recognition of they separate political claim in 1914 . if the tradition still exist today and it appear that it very much do so it implies that the unite kingdom do not have for many loyalist a natural character of statehood in the way the southern state have for catholic nationalist .
though the republican lose the war , they eventually win they case with they successful introduction of the republican constitution of 1937 . this show the extent to which the republican ideal gain ground once independence be in place , furthere the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism . despite this development , the struggle between the two previously warr faction have continue , the original republican develope a populist , nationalist	party	develop a concern with law and order , and moderation on the national question . but the fight do not prevent the fundamental beliefs in the nation and the historic integrity of the island of ireland , as nationalist party descri it in they new ireland forum ( 1983 4 : i . 28 ) , from remain basic to the perception of both party . the gaelic - irish component
this show the extent to which the republican ideal gain ground once independence be in place , furthere the ideological divide between protestant loyalism and catholic nationalism . despite this development , the struggle between the two previously warr faction have continue , the original republican develope a populist , nationalist party , and the former treaty party develop a concern with law and order , and moderation on the national question . but the fight do not prevent the fundamental beliefs in the nation and the historic integrity of the island of ireland , as nationalist	party	. the gaelic - irish component from the early year of the southern state , cultural nationalism be deliberately develop by government means .
from 1911 to 1914 , the irish high clergy make successive attack on the trade union movement and on socialism . rumpf and hepburn ( 1977 ) viow the activity of the church during this period as quite decisive in limit the appeal of socialism for the irish subordinate classes until the 1950 . the emergence of a new pro - capitalist	party	in the south from the end of 1985 , the progressive democratic party , might show the extent to which political division base on the treaty and within the nationalist component of hegemony may have become problematic , to be partially replace by an even much explicit concern with increase the popular wealth and prosperity . indeed , in the irish general election of 1987 , progressive democrat take 14 seat , and 11.8 per cent of the total vote , which be sizeable for a young political party . the decline of the labour element in the sdlp in the north , however , do indicate a trend to the style of politics in the republic , that be towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance .
the decline of the labour element in the sdlp in the north , however , do indicate a trend to the style of politics in the republic , that be towards the suppression of class politics and identity in line with the dominant ideology of the alliance . the national question as such still remain a central preoccupation for catholic nationalist . because the nation be see as only partially liberate , and particularly by the membership of the large	party	fianna fil , the animus of the national - popular consciousness be focuse on this issue , to the detriment of class - base politics . there have , therefore , be little chance in the past for a political growth of class consciousness among subordinate group . what socialism there have be among the catholic nationalist tradition have always tend to be ally to republicanism , especially in the period 1913 to 1930 ( rumpf and hepburn 1977 : 13 ) .
the dual source of the state 's role in hegemony helps we understand the limitation of the state in respect of the alliance who power it also represent . this be why collection by the provisional in public house be have partial success in the 1970 without too much interference by the garda , the republic 's police force . the collection indicate a wide hide culture of support for the lad who be at the forefront of the battle to restore national unity , in addition to the much small	party	political support they enjoy in the south . the roman catholic church , in episcopal statement , unequivocally condemn violence north or south . as see in chapter 3 , this be also true in the nineteen century , despite low clergy support particularly for the fenian movement .
there can be no doubt that the lack of such a programme bore heavily upon the poor , and that poor health and mortality be a consequence . in 1946 there be already sign of clerical opposition to any socialization of welfare in query about fianna fil 's proposal from archbishop mcquaid and the confederation of convent school . as have already be see , it be the style of both church and politician to avoid they mutual consultation be know , which tell we that the secularity of the state at that time be partially a faade , but one which it be feel by both interested	party	have to be maintain , probably so as not to confuse the faithful . in a letter to the irish premier in 1947 , while an extensive health bill be go through parliament , the bishop point out that to claim such power for the public authority , without qualification , be entire and directly contrary to catholic teach on the right of the family , the church in education , the right of the medical profession and voluntary institution ( irish independent , 12 apr . 1951 , quote whyte 1980 : 143 ) . it appear that one of the main source of the bishop 's opposition be the authoritarian nature of the legislation .
the next significant event of constitutional relevance be the important initiative take by the nationalist party in ireland in 19834 , the new ireland forum . this be an initiative sponsore by the sdlp at first intended to bring together politician from both catholic nationalist and protestant loyalist group to discuss the future of the island as a whole . in reality only the major nationalist	party	participate . loyalist partie refuse to join in , and the provisional sinn fein be exclude by the fact that the ground rule for the forum only allow party accept constitutional , nonviolent politics to participate . the forum complete it consultation and report in the summer of 1984 .
the new ireland must be a society within which , subject only to public order , all cultural , political and religious beliefs can be freely express and practise . this be make explicit in term of the sense of british identity which protestan loyalist experience : this implies in particular , in respect of northern protestant , that the civil and religious liberty that they uphold and enjoy will be fully protect and they sense of britishness accommodate ( new ireland forum 19834 : i . 223 ) . for the very first time , the leadership of all the major constitutional nationalist	party	in ireland , represent 90 per cent of the nationalist population , have abandon the concept of the tyranny of the majority will . the people of ireland be not identify as the catholic nationalist population . there be still trac of ethnocentrism in the nationalist viewpoint elsewhere in the report : for instance , they still refer to the historic integrity of ireland ( new ireland forum 19834 : i . 28 ) , imply an almost naturalistic concept of irish unity , when as a political unit ireland only ever exist as a british - administer territory .
fianna fil appear to be equally divide on the issue . the new progressive democrat come out in favour of the referendum proposal on 14 may . of the small	party	, the worker 's party be the much decisive in favour the change . other public body who active campaign on behalf of the constitutional amendment be the irish congress of trade unions and the irish council for civil liberty . the presbyterian and methodist church in ireland , along with the church of ireland , welcome the proposal .
divorce be see to be harder on the woman than the man , who could get out of they family responsibility so much very easily with divorce than without it . in oppose the argument marshall by the anti - divorce group , the pro - divorce group argue that , despite the existence of divorce legislation in northern ireland , there be still a low divorce rate . the period of separation in undefended cas be two year , and five year have to run if one of the	party	oppose the divorce . that man in particular do not benefit from the procedure be suggest by the fact that twice as many woman as man fil for divorce . it be argue that the pattern in other country be that law permitt divorce follow social trend in the number of marriage breakdown rather than vice versa and that the fear of societal breakdown promote by opponent in ireland be unfound in fact .
far criticism come from roman catholic in britain . an editorial in the catholic herald and standard on 25 may it be distribute in ireland as the standard criticize the irish bishop ' apparently low esteem of they laity 's ability to remain constant in they marriage . also a call from the alliance party in the north be make by john cushnahan ,	party	leader . he find it ironic that anyone who support the anglo - irish agreement could oppose a mode measure to introduce divorce ( irish time , 28 june 1986 ) . perhaps an important counter to the archbishop of dublin 's intervention be the well - know lie liberal catholic and head of information at rte , louis mcredmond .
the failure have continue for a period of , or period amounte to , at little five year , iii . there be no reasonable possibility of reconciliation between the	party	to the marriage , and iv . any other condition prescrib by law have be comply with ,
the bishop be successful in urge the irish party to accept the church 's programme for irish education as a whole . they success be founded on a dual strategy . on the one hand they subscrib to the annual irish parliamentary	party	as the true political representative of the irish people and it interest in the british parliament . even a castle bishop such as archbishop healy , now announce he conversion to the nationalist cause . in other word , support for the education policy of the church be the quid the irish party have to give in order to obtain the quo of the bishop 's endorsement of the party as the genuine political representative of the irish people or nation .
on the one hand they subscrib to the annual irish parliamentary party fund and , on the other , they public praise the irish party as the true political representative of the irish people and it interest in the british parliament . even a castle bishop such as archbishop healy , now announce he conversion to the nationalist cause . in other word , support for the education policy of the church be the quid the irish	party	as the genuine political representative of the irish people or nation . the agreement over education be so clear that when the first revolutionary irish government set it up in 1918 , prior to negotiate independence , there be no minister for education . and when the irish free state do emerge in 1921 , practically the entire school system be under the control of the church .
the burden of the message be that good catholic parent send they child to catholic school . the curate add to this that that promot the integrate project be in fact promote secularism . the fact that a prominent member of the current community council and an integrate education supporter be a member of official sinn fein , the worker 's	party	have always be suspect to be an anti - clerical and secularist force . in resident 's association meeting , the clergy 's point of view receive vocal support from one or two member of the old village community which preced the house estate . the total of that favour denominational school in the initial survey be less than one - third .
mr murray now want to give away the smuggler ' kitchen so that he can channel he effort into another property the dartmoor inn at bovey tracey , also in devon . he have identify the need for a fish restaurant in the surround area . however , interested	party	have to fulfil the follow prerequisite : be young , enthusiastic and part of a team , with some experience of the cater industry ;

i would not wear muddy hunt boot if i be go to climb in through a bedroom window and murder a lady , say ethel . the word take time to sink in to he as much as to the rest . it be not as though a gentleman would only bring one or two pair of shoe with he to a house -	party	. they sit there think . final it be again ethel who speak .

super super series ! although no formal proposal have yet be announce by anyone , there be no doubt that the idea for a super super series , as i suppose it should be call , be gain momentum . the problem , of course , would be reach agreement with all	party	concern , as to which event , other than the four grand slam , would be include . one theory be there should be sydney , a week earlier than at present , lead into the australian open , the stella artois championship as the traditional prelude to wimbledon , plus cincinnati and indianapoli on the way into the u.s open . rather much controversial would be decide which tournament should take pride of place in the european clay court season lead into paris .

however , he have never state that this be in fact the case . i would also state i belief that in relation to class aa , we parent company have behave entire properly ; the process of apply for a patent necessarily entail wide publication and ample opportunity for opposition . i willing accept that an inventor cannot scrutinise every patent application ; by the same teak a manufacturer cannot contact all potentially interested	party	. i view about the matsushita response be simply that the japanese higher education system general require knowledge of english , which seem at odd with the technics explanation . the basic variation in the technics circuit arrangement have necessitate a set - up procedure , not present in i circuit .
all i can say to the objector in both category be that that who do not see a problem do not have a problem , and they can happily ignore what i have write . but other reader will , i imagine , accept the general drift of what i have say , whilst disagree on many point of detail . not want to seem too negative , i have outlin way in which the discipline of english as currently constitute might divide , to the benefit of both	party	. but know how the academic mind works , i be not optimistic about change . as noel annan wrote in he life of leslie stephen : the ingenuity in argument , the subtlety in draw distinction , the dexterous prevarication , the imperative reason for procrastination , perpetually bewild and confound the novice in university administration .

as in 1963 , so today there be a strong sense that the tide be turn . but the tory still have time to recover , especially if they jettison some of the much unattractive aspect of thatcherism . mr kinnock 's job at conference must be to demonstrate labour 's electability by confirme the	party	's new revisionism , by reassure voter on issue where there be still doubt and , above all , by help set the agenda for the 1990 . the party have abandone policy which make it unelectable in the 1980 . it be no long the party of traditional nationalisation ; it be no long anti - european ; above all , it be no long unilateralist .

here mr kinnock should set out clearly why , in the gorbachev era , negotiate rather than unilateral disarmament be almost always preferable . on the economy , there be still work to do . poll show that , despite impressive performance by john smith and gordon brown , many voter still believe labou be a	party	of high taxation and inflation . but there be strong support for sensible increase in public spending , provide this do not lead to massive hike in taxation . the party have to emphasise that , in contrast to the tory , it believe public spending should rise in line with growth in output , but that it will pursue responsible fiscal policy .

i be disappoint the policy review have adopt such a negative attitude both to a bill of right and electoral reform . a new agendum , centr on citizen 's right and democratic reform , selective government intervention , environmental protection and a much positive role in europe would provide the basis for a new progressive majority . it must be mr kinnock 's task this week to capture this new agenda for labour and set the	party	on the path to power . disturbingly quiet on the western front by william rees - mogg

if it do not exist , would anyone trouble to invent it at a time when , from the atlantic to the ural , socialism in all it manifestation be lose the argument to liberal capitalism for we should not become too carry away by labour 's change face and tone of voice , nor too dazzle by the peter mandelson image - conjur . the	party	may have put on a collar and tie but it be still the labour party , prone to it old reflex ( as it remind we yesterday on defence spend ) , prisoner still of it anachronistic structure , it mind set in 100 year of work - class history . listen to the first day 's proceeding , i find i not transport into the future so much as revisite the past . here be the labour party revert to it old self , a good self , yes , than the monster it become under the demonic spell of tony benn ; here be a party responsive once very to it own people , the people it so shamefully betray at two successive general election since 1979 , but a party as somebody once say of the sdp - promise a good yesterday .
the party may have put on a collar and tie but it be still the labour party , prone to it old reflex ( as it remind we yesterday on defence spend ) , prisoner still of it anachronistic structure , it mind set in 100 year of work - class history . listen to the first day 's proceeding , i find i not transport into the future so much as revisite the past . here be the labour party revert to it old self , a good self , yes , than the monster it become under the demonic spell of tony benn ; here be a	party	as somebody once say of the sdp - promise a good yesterday . here it be still with it delegation and block vote , composite motion and reference back of it convolute proceduralism , it quaint form of speech and style of address comrade , brother , sister , chair . a sufficient moral universe it may remain for that who inhabit it , but they be a dwindle band and for large area of the country labour 's world be a cultural world apart .
here it be still with it delegation and block vote , composite motion and reference back of it convolute proceduralism , it quaint form of speech and style of address comrade , brother , sister , chair . a sufficient moral universe it may remain for that who inhabit it , but they be a dwindle band and for large area of the country labour 's world be a cultural world apart . amy the euphorium of it seven - point opinion poll lead , the	party	's own pollster have remind it that in the south the conservative lead 47 - 33 while in the midlands and wales the race remain too close to call . in this region , the conservative vote be down respectively by only 5 and 3 per cent on 1987 , not enough to suggest widespread labour gain come 1992 . in a masterly television interview on sunday , john smith , the shadow chancellor , exude competence and an almost gladstonian fiscal probity , but there be a ring of the sixty about the accompany discussion between mp and expert which leave the impression that , in squar circle , the labour party remain endemically the party of inflation .
amy the euphorium of it seven - point opinion poll lead , the party 's own pollster have remind it that in the south the conservative lead 47 - 33 while in the midlands and wales the race remain too close to call . in this region , the conservative vote be down respectively by only 5 and 3 per cent on 1987 , not enough to suggest widespread labour gain come 1992 . in a masterly television interview on sunday , john smith , the shadow chancellor , exude competence and an almost gladstonian fiscal probity , but there be a ring of the sixty about the accompany discussion between mp and expert which leave the impression that , in squar circle , the labour party remain endemically the	party	of inflation . the abandonment yesterday of unilateral nuclear disarmament ( although not the intention of abando britain 's nuclear deterrent at the earli opportunity while other country keep they ) be do in the same spirit of moralism which have go into the banning of the bomb . once very the world be treat as a convenience wrap for labour 's parochial and predominantly internal preoccupation .
much determination and hard work have go into that attempt , but it be now see to have fail . without reform , failure will become much complete . yet if the gdr be to become a multi -	party	democracy , it would lose it identify ideology and become a pallid shadow of the federal republic : less grossly consumerist , perhaps , but also less desirable . in bonn it be hope that there can be order change across the border , soon enough to convince much east german that life be worth living there . perhaps because to think about reform be to think about it purpose , mr honecker and he colleague keep they mind close to such challenge .
we naturally welcome labour 's exist promise to repeal section 28 and to legislate against discrimination in the workplace . and few would disagree that , give the fanaticism and sheer ferocity of tabloid prejudice , it would be unreasonable for gay people to expect that labour should adopt we cause as an election issue . however , the water down of a basic and principle commitment , within labour or any other libertarian	party	, especially in response to intimidation by newspaper of such a spurious morality , could prive deep discredit . it be with regard to this principle , but very important to the actual fact of persecution , that we urge the support of labour 's leader and membership by restor , this week , a policy commitment to full equality for lesbian and gay man . letter : israeli motive

it be now rushe to finalise a bold programme of reform . but the emphasis on new priority be troubl some of it traditional clientele . the change have be strike in two area , with woman 's issue and environmental concern thrust to the head of the	party	agenda . there have be an influx of woman into the party , accompany by a decision to have equal representation at all level of the party by the mid - 1990 . and the party have be devise an environmentally - friend economic strategy .
the change have be strike in two area , with woman 's issue and environmental concern thrust to the head of the party agenda . there have be an influx of woman into the party , accompany by a decision to have equal representation at all level of the party by the mid - 1990 . and the	party	have be devise an environmentally - friend economic strategy . it central theme be to make polluter pay , start with a proposed 30 per cent rise in the price of petrol . we be get away from the labour party for industrial worker , say walter momper , the spd mayor of berlin and one of the new generation of leader .
it have not always be easy for that work class voter who see the greens as an undisciplined bunch , inimical to the interest of industrial society , to keep up with the spd 's enthusiastic appetite for environmental matter . there have be a noticeable shift of work class support from the spd to the far - right republican not as much as the loss from the christian democrat , but enough to worry party manager . the difference in we electorate be much big than for the conservative party , say heidi wieczorek - zeul , a member of the	party	praesidium . tactically to combine the interest of a miner and an environmentalist just do not work . it can only be do with conviction , with the sort of approach we use in 1969 with ostpolitik .
it can only be do with conviction , with the sort of approach we use in 1969 with ostpolitik . today , ecological and woman 's issue be the equivalent of ostpolitik for we . the	party	ever contemplate , have avoid the sort of fratricidal bloodlett which ravage it british counterpart . the traditionalist camp have have to swallow some bitter pill . oskar lafontaine , the spd leader in the saarland , have argue vociferously that a modern mass party like the spd could not afford to have it policy confin to the narrow interest of employ industrial worker .
oskar lafontaine , the spd leader in the saarland , have argue vociferously that a modern mass party like the spd could not afford to have it policy confin to the narrow interest of employ industrial worker . in the party 's new programme , the trade union have have to backtrack on they central demand , now accept that a shorter work week will mean reduce wage . but mr lafontaine , standard - bearer of the up - and - come generation , and the second much important figure after mr vogel on the committee draft the	party	programme for the next decade , have certainly not have thing all he own way . he attempt to link reduction in work hour to very flexible work practice , for example , have run into powerful union resistance . the spd 's candidate for chancellor seem to be narrow to a choice between mr vogel and mr lafontaine , between a cautious compromiser and an erratic reformer .
the party be far from sure which message it want to send to voter , and be likely to leave the choice until the last minute . neither of this two man can control with any certainty , however , the factor that will perhaps exert the many influence on the spd 's election chance . whether the	party	like it or not , it fortune be hostage to the still youthful coalition in frankfurt and berlin , and they notoriously unpredictable green ally . if this coalition fall apart , as an early version do in hesse in 1987 amid much rancour , the repercussion could be disastrous , with the christian democrat poise to exploit any hint of red - green chao . if we be not successful in berlin , then the chanc of a red - green coaliion in bonn be go for five to ten year , say walter momper .
despite he lack of political experience , clouthier be 20 - year leadership of business organisation stand he in good stead . after the bank 's nationalisation he sell much of he interest in the dozen or so company he have create and draw he wealth from , and commit he to combat the exist political system . he quickly establish he within the pan , challenge it professional politician with the support of he business colleague and unify the fractious	party	. he take conservative idea on privatisation and land reform , give they a populist anti - government bend and manage to woo over many poorer voter - especially in northern mexico who previously fear that the pan represent only business interest . he promise to demystify the all - powerful presidency and make it very accountable to congress and the voter .
he be popular as a man of the people who toure mexico with he wife and 10 child in a mobile home during the presidential campaign , a very different strategy from the typically aloof approach of the pan 's other wealthy and middle - class leader . he blustery manner bring out large crowd despite frequent government attempt to intimidate rural population into stay away . ultimately clouthier 's campaign fall victim to the rise of the left and the governing	party	we shift to the right . clouthy pull in 17 per cent of the vote , fall into third place . many of the pan 's traditional supporter appear to abandon the party to support salina for fear the left might win .
lord justice dillon say that it be not in doubt that if the copy be privilege in relation to the employee 's then claim because obtain for the purpose of advice in relation to that claim , it retain it privilege condition in respect of the subsequent claim now be advance by the bank : pearce v foster ( 1885 ) 15 qbd 114 . the basis of the privilege on ground of law go back many year . it be for the	party	refus to disclose to establish he right to refuse . the onus therefore be on the defendant . affidavit from the defendant 's solicitor establish that the photocopy affidavit be supply to they by the second defendant for the purpose of seek legal advice in circumstance where litigation be contemplate , but do not indicate whether the photocopy sent be a photocopy which the second defendant make for the purpose of instruct he solicitor or a photocopy which have be send to the second defendant by the employee he , prepare for the employee 's own purpose which have nothing whatever to do with the defendant obtain legal advice from they soliticor .
but he warn that correct the mistake of the present administration would not be easy . he say : look at the problem 12 year of tory mismanagement will bequeath to we ; a balance of payment deficit financ by hot money , casino - type operation money which will fly away at the prospect of a labour victory . the labour party conference : policy review a symbol of	party	renewal by stephen goodwin labourhave policy review be a symbol of the party renew it and become again a force for change , tom sawyer , deputy general secretary of nupe , the public sector worker 's union , say at the start of four day of debate on the review report .

brighton : we be fit to serve we country , say neil kinnock , the labour party leader , in the peroration to the peroration of an epic speech to conference . if that sound a bit like the result of an army medical board it be appropriate enough : the chief purpose of this year 's conference be to signal that the labour party be ready once very for active service . indeed , mr kinnock call for a modest celebration at labour 's recovery : it be an encouragement , an inspiration to see the	party	work together once very , he say . this be he way of declare that the battle for the labour party be won and the battle for britain about to commence . such declaration be of little intrinsic importance but they tell we something of how a politician see the world and he own place in it .
this be he way of declare that the battle for the labour party be won and the battle for britain about to commence . such declaration be of little intrinsic importance but they tell we something of how a politician see the world and he own place in it . this be the first year since he become leader of he	party	and be able to turn he attention properly to the government of the country . hence , this be the first of he conference performance which be aim primarily at the nation . it be a severe test for he , for it be a widely held view that he talent as a party manage be not match by he capability as a potential prime minister .
it be a severe test for he , for it be a widely held view that he talent as a party manage be not match by he capability as a potential prime minister . how do he do not bad at all , give the immense difficulty of restor credibility to labou as a	party	of government . mr kinnock stagger under the additional handicap of have no ministerial experience which would equip he for the supreme office to which he aspire . he be the child of labour 's crisis which resulte in he ideological credential be prefer to the experience and qualification of he rival .
today he have sh a good deal of that ideology he speech yesterday be social democratic through and through but he remain devoid of the work experience relevan to he next task which be to convince the country that he , and labour , be qualify to form the next government . the much successful feature of he speech be he recruitment of the future to labour 's cause . all election in two -	party	parliamentary system be essentially about whether or not it be time for a change . yesterday mr kinnock present a picture of a world change so rapid around the present government that the prime minister have become out of touch , out of date and out of step with the british people . as she enter she second decade in power , this promise to be an effective line of attack .
a recent protestant church synod , where speaker air grievance and call for change , be a conspiracy to prepare the way for reunification . east germany have defeate the class enemy and create a superior society where human being can develop free of exploitation . what do fast car and travel count for , the	party	's youth organ ask , compare with the warmth of family , love , friendship , security and harmony the whole thing , of course , be be blow up out of all proportion by the western medium . absurd though it may seem , it be quite likely that mr honecker and he companion genuinely believe all this .
they lead privilege life in official residence , be drive everywhere in official car , buy from special shop and , it be say , have unpleasant fact screen from they by fawn officials . last year , johanne rau , the social democrat prime minister of north rhine - westphalia , ask mr honecker why the mood among he people be so bad . he reply , the unity of the mass with the	party	be never so strong as now . the people be behind the party . and he invite he to come to the mayday parade to see for he .

woman see british society as too unequal , too competitive , too materialistic and too greedy . woman want much equality , very social service , few weapon and little pollution . but m short add : women share we value but we be see by this woman as male dominate and the much unsympathetic of all the	party	. this debate should recognise we concern to put this right with much woman at all level . but some woman campaigner late protest that the debate , chair by david blunkett , have be rig to silence they objection .
the labour party conference : path out of poverty define by smith by stephen goodwin labour delegate be warn yesterday that the	party	would lack electoral credibilty if it promise increase in public spending which could only be meet by high borrowing or tax . underlin last weekend 's commitment by john smith , the shadow chancellor , to control spend , giles radice , mp for durham north , tell the conference that properly financ public spending be not only good economic , but good politics . svote have to be certain labour 's programme be properly cost .
but if member of labour 's philosophical tendency , from tony benn to bryan gould , be choos they word careful it may be through fear of how they will look in each other 's diary . weary constituency and trade union delegate , queue for a cup of tea and a sandwich , constantle risk end up with a signed copy of someone 's memoir . around the brighton conference centre , academic tract on the	party	's past and future course seem to proliferate daily . to a fever imagination , it seem no one can turn a corner in the crowded conference complex without run into a mug shot of one or other high - theoretician leer pensive from a wall of hardback dust cover . they debate on labour 's plight rag far above the brawle oratory in the conference hall .

i want to be alone . that be the constant theme . colleague say last night that the speech mark a change of gear as mr kinnock move away from	party	organisation and policy and accelerate into the election campaign . lord callaghan , the last labour prime minister , say : what happen in the 1980 be a temporary aberration from what have always be the real position of the labour party , and neil kinnock have recapture the traditional position . but mr kinnock stress in he speech that give the inevitable and unprecedent mess which would be leave behind by mrs thatcher , a labour government would have to set and unflinchingly stick to four basic priority .
warn that there be no single mechanism which would catapult britain to economic strength , mr kinnock say : research and development , transport and communication , science , education and train ; they be the priority . they be the productive base of we economy . they be prerequisite an unparalleled priority for deal with inflation , the balance of payment deficit , unemployment , and fund the	party	's policy for social justice . have deliver he tough message , mr kinnock turn to prime target of the conservative record top off with high intere rate , which he liken to a policy of assassination for mortgage - holder . even if the conservative take the brake off in the run - up to the next election , people would not be deceive .
be it criticism there be a massive amount of wri about art , only some of which can immediately be identify by a reader as criticism . write by the art critic of a newspaper be self - evidently criticism , in parallel with the write of music and theatre critics ; an exhibition can be treat almost in the same way as a	performance	. articles in magazine be less certainly descri as criticism , for they main topic may be personality or history , and art may be only a small part of the writer 's account . book and catalogue may contain criticism ; but they writer may think of they as art historian , philosopher , aesthetician , anthropologist , historian or biographer , and there be many other possibility ; they book may never be identify as art criticism .
let we walk with a visitor through the city , a veteran of the second world war who value it as one which be almost unscath from the bomb which devastate so many european city . he start at a medieval gothic window , a remnant of the first university in central europe ( founded 1348 ) ; he pause at the rebuilt bethlehem chapel , the site of where the mass be first allow in czech , and jan hus preach before be burnt for heresy in 1413 ; he pay respect to the relic of the jewish quarter with it ancient and crowded graveyard ; to cross the river he use the charles bridge , line with baroque statue ( many between 1700 and 1720 ) , and climb the hill to the castle where art and architecture of all period again far embellish the golden city of central europe . in the evening we friend have supper in the art nouveau interior of the hotel europe , before go to a	performance	at the national theatre , buil in the 1880 as a monument to the czech national spirit , pinion under the austro - hungarian empire . as he have enjoy he day , he sleep sound without a nightmare about what be specifically czechoslovak in the sight . the truth be that nationality in art have limit importance .
historian can point to the philosophical view which underlie this ambition , and artist and sculptor be in various way affect by the demonstration of it realisation in the theatre built for the composer at bayreuth . the collaboration of artist with the stage be also bring to a high point by serge diaghilev , in he commissions to artist for the russian ballet . this connection between paint and the theatre be important to earlier european art in religious as well as secular	performance	. critic no less than artist have wide interest in the art , and may introduce comparison in they interpretation . in the nineteen century to say that a picture be poetic be a common term of praise .
clearly artist work in several medium have a wide range of reference . the art critic be thus bind to consider with care what standard of comparison should be use . in the late twenty century artist work in	performance	pose difficultie for the critic , though some observer find it refresh rather than troublesome to consider work beyond the easel picture and the individual sculpture . in sum , then , the monograph be a major site for art critical write , and , moreover , the place where the much extended criticism be likely to appear . the reader may be disappoint by the standard of what be write , but unlike other site of criticism , this cannot be attribute to the form of publication , only to the limitation of the author .
but if roth dissent from the statement , then imagin how he come to write much of he book become a problem . zuckerman tell he maria : be zuckerman be one long	performance	and the very opposite of what be think of as be one . in fact , that who much seem to be they appear to i people impersonat what they think they might like to be , believe they ought to be , or wish to be take to be by whoever be set standard . so in earnest be they that they do not even recognise that be in earnest be the act .
the man upstairs , the first husband who maria be to leave , be not self - aware unlike zuckerman , who declare , on behalf of the self - aware , that he have no self and that the self be a joke . but roth must know that it be likely to be no joke to that who be read he book . zuckerman say here that	performance	be all there be , that person and persona be one . but we may feel on read this that it take two to perform that performance require , in however regressive or circular a fashion , the self that so many people believe they have , and that this epistolary zuckerman exhibit here , in a display of inadvertence which may or may not implicate philip roth . this be a self which there may be no way of prove .
but roth must know that it be likely to be no joke to that who be read he book . zuckerman say here that performance be all there be , that person and persona be one . but we may feel on read this that it take two to perform that	performance	require , in however regressive or circular a fashion , the self that so many people believe they have , and that this epistolary zuckerman exhibit here , in a display of inadvertence which may or may not implicate philip roth . this be a self which there may be no way of prove . it be a self which be prove , for philosopher , hard to prive .
when we turn to the theatre the question of scale be also significant . the theatre be large than life , not in term of physical scale , but because movement and speech be comparative emphatic and intense , even when a play simulate everyday natural surrounding . some people find this make theatre less believable less true to they own experience and therefore less convince than the much restrain	performance	see on television and cinema . theatre invite you to give you full attention to what be happen on stage the theatrical experience be a very concentrate one and you as a member of the audience be vitally connect to what be go on . as part of the audience you be as much a part of the entertainment as the performance it , and this be something that dramatist be aware of and have always write for .
some people find this make theatre less believable less true to they own experience and therefore less convince than the much restrained performance see on television and cinema . theatre invite you to give you full attention to what be happen on stage the theatrical experience be a very concentrate one and you as a member of the audience be vitally connect to what be go on . as part of the audience you be as much a part of the entertainment as the	performance	it , and this be somethe that dramatist be aware of and have always write for . sometimes you will be directly address by the character this be something which happen a great deal in greek and elizabethan theatre ( for example , look at the speech by chorus in act 4 , scene 1 of henry v , which draw the audience into the atmosphere before a battle enormously effective ) . it be also use as a dramatic device by many contemporary playwright .
so , what can you learn from look so closely at the actor on stage , tv and cinema in the first place you will start to think about how an actor 's work differ according to the demand of the medium . and you will become aware of technical skills notice economy of effect and style , see and hear how an actor interpret a script , and how he think come across in a	performance	. of course , if an actor be do his/her work well , you will have to work really hard to notice all this thing for the effect will be seamless . read
but you may not actual learn much , simply because the main object of the group will not be to help you but to get on and do the play , rely on the skills available and hope that the audience will give adequate support . so what else can you do in recent year the amateur actor have have much opportunity for classes in theatre work , includ voice and movement train as well as	performance	and directe skills . this facility differ in all part of the world , but in britain the evening class be probably the much accessible form of training . london be obviously where many of the opportunity abound .
but when you be look for a suitable speech you can not really reject anything familiar solely because you think it might bore the panel . it be true that extract such as phoebe 's think not that i love he from as you like it ( act 3 , scene 5 ) or viola be 1 leave no ring with she from twelfth night ( act 2 , scene 2 ) may be all too well know to a panel , but i cannot agree with an adjudication policy that would ban this piece from the audition . the selection be right if it truly work for the compet student , and it be the quality and force of the imagination that will carry off the	performance	of the piece . the much important thing be you firm knowledge that the selection be within you present range . it be not much use arrive somewhere at ten in the morning clutch the collect work under you arm and wish you have a wig and be born thirty year earlier in order to play lear or for that matter the duke of gloucester .
what you will eventually be work toward be a fusion of instinct and technique , and train be very largely to do with improve technical skills . at drama school , there be constant attention to a student 's control of both voice and movement , and the different departments work at develop a student 's overall act technique . the emphasis will be on develope an actor 's mental and physical concentration , and give him/her sufficient craftsmanship to sustain a	performance	. classes the first term be always an unsettle time , and it generally take a few week before student become familiar with each other , and work together effective .
much class last for an hour or perhaps an hour and a half . in the first term , rehearsal for the production project will usually be around two hour in length , but progressive much time will be spend on this aspect of the course as the student advance . ideally the class support the work do on the production project and it be particularly valuable if there be strong liaison between voice and movement tutor with the director of a project not little in help student see how the instructional classes connect with they own	performance	. if drama school do not incorporate a stage management course , basic lecture and some participation in production work may take place in the senior term . it be always useful for a student of act to have some practical knowledge of stage management , help him/her to appreciate the need for efficient technical support for any production .
and a trained singe voice be undoubted a valued asset there may well be some competition for a place on singe tutorial . the first production the text for the first term 's production will usually be select for the purpose of get a new group to work together rather than try to go for detailed individual	performance	. the range be obviously very wide , and you may find you in a greek tragedy , or even a modern exercise play such as games by james saunder , where the student may add to the text by research material which can be incorporate in the project . either way , the main intention will be to establish a way of work , and to begin assesse student 's voice and movement abilitie .
the piece test the actor 's awareness and imagination to the full , but nevertheless make precise demand on he : he must follow exactly what the author say . throughout drama school there will be continuous work on act solo piece , and both sing and act tutorial be usually conduct on a one to one basis ( very on tutorial in chapter 7 ) . of course the student also need to learn how to co - ordinate dialogue with all of the necessary action and movement which be part of the natural traffic of	performance	, and learn about prop handle . classes help the actor to gain confidence in deal with many thing happen at the same time , and this be an important part of student work . radio , television and film class
unfortunately , it be often difficult to get agents to attend this production . much drama school final production be stage over a similar sort of schedule , which mean agents be ask to see student 's work over a fair compress period . agent be notify of	performance	. remember , though , that badger agents be quite useless ; if they want to come they will come , but telephon they and oversell you can be just as useless as not let they know that you be alive and worke . it will be the same story for many moon to come .
amanda i do not think there 's a style of voice , thank goodness . but there be the chance of work with cicely berry , who be so wonderful at add in a positive ,	performance	orientate way to all the thing you have learnt about voice . and of course hold together a part like juliet with long gap between the performance night and no real rehearsal in between be difficult to do that can be rather hairy . sometimes you be a week away from the last performance you give and then find you out there so that the voice and understand of the part do need constant refresh .

which be right be have no resemblance to what be commercially think of a typecast in any way it be just that the mixture be right with simon callow . a.r and late much later at the national theatre play the young captain absolute do that grow out of be see in this	performance	p.r . i be sure it do .
i have be very lucky ; the right opportunity have come along and yet every time you take they you be look forward immediately to the next challenge . i mean the much excit moment of all be when you be actual chose for a part after that initial excitement it be a bit downhill not because the work be not marvellous but because the first challenge be the peak . i think everyone need the director to be vital interested in the work well beyond the first week of actual	performance	. in the west end there seem at the moment a tendency to rely too much on the goodwill of actor which be often accompany by a failure to maintain a true interest in what be go on for the actor . perhaps director in particular need to realise how much they vitality mean to the continuing performance that it be not enough to be leave up on a stage mere do it night after night .

d. . not at all . i can remember do bartholomew fair at the royal court theatre with the nyt and see all the scenery and light down on the stage at the end of the last	performance	and think how exci it be to belong to the world of make - believe . a.r. and be that you reason for become an actor
this ideology of the state be coercive implement in the policing , arrest , try , convict , and imprison of that find to default . but this coercive role be partly perform by citizen too . section of the population assist the police in the	performance	of they duty not just by tak on gunman or robber but also by make telephone call to the police . they thus form an extension of the coercive dimension of the state . they consider such action as they duty as citizens .
not music but transformation of sound - wave already in the air . perhaps colour - wave too , if technology ready in time . twenty - four hour non - stop	performance	. after that plan similar experience world - wide . perhaps to last a year .
the conversation continue after delivery , with train for the staff who be to use the system , and support service while the system be in use . technology supplier to the british hotel and restaurant industry say that they product be often under - exploit , because too little think have be give to what the system be suppose to achieve and too low a priority be give to staff training . one industry spokesman comment : the overall	performance	of computerised management system within the hotel industry relate very to the attitude of manager towards training and the commitment of they supplier than it do to the superiority of the individual system . two contentious issue be the cost of train to manager and the same manager 's grasp of system ( or the lack of it ) . it be claime that cater college have fail to get to grip with the development of technology , acknowledge it importance and provide student with a level of understand base on the industry 's need .
she target be an excessively tall gangl gentleman , not very suitable clad for the mediterranean in a suit of gingery wool with the trouser end in tight band round the calf . he be lean against the rail smoke a cigarette and stare with an air of melancholy towards the distant island . not a very lady - like	performance	, the ample , beflower lady pronounce , with a look of pinch disapproval in the direction of the girl in the prow . brief lif he cap , the ging giant produce , in foreign - accent english , a decidedly non - committal reply . the large lady be not to be put off , however .
it be a case which , i be afraid to tell you , have it own begin and middle and alas an end too . here , mrs pettifer begin to interject but the small gentleman silenc she with a flap of the wrist which be altogether not very gentlemanly and prove too much for the great lady detective who make a much purposeful interjection of she own . this be very intereste , she say , but i be afraid that it be nothing much than a	performance	. it be a very clever performance what they call in theatrical circle a beautiful performance . but it be still no much than a performance .

this be very intereste , she say , but i be afraid that it be nothing much than a performance . it be a very clever performance what they call in theatrical circle a beautiful performance . but it be still no much than a	performance	. not real . this person claims to be a great detective and yet he have detect nothing , nothing at all .
claire would not speak to i . i try to tell she about the horrible man on the doorstep but she would not listen . the next day i overhear she tell mother about how that spasmo ballet company have cancell the rest of they	performance	and go home . she say it be tragic because of kezia , and the way she go on you will have think it be all i fault . the way i see it if i have save the world from a lot of bor bel dancer i ought to be congratulate .
there will be festival information point at mac and the triangle . venue information mac offer a vary programme of events ( theatre , cinema , dance and music	performance	, literary events , festival and puppet show ) and course ( art , craft , music , dance and drama ) for adult and child . the centre be locate in beautiful parkland and have a bar , cafe and free park . for people with disability recent improvement have make the theatre , cinema reception , ticket office , cafe and bar fully accessible by wheelchay .
the nearly half a year between i interview and i start there pass without incident . truth be tell , i can not really remember what i do do in that six month . over the summer i do read a few book and tentative prepare a few classes , but it be indisputable a pretty lacklustre	performance	on i part . i have manage to convince i that , after a lifetime of teach at university level , this be all go to be painfully easy . i decide to keep up i flat in london and find fair basic lodging locally .
i think long and hard about it but in the end i decide it would be for the good . although jeff make i laugh at i be the begin of the end of i depression , it be not enough to persuade i to stay . what tip the balance against that be i continue dreadful	performance	in the classroom . anyway , jeff have now give i something now something really important to i . it be something i want to try out somewhere else .
favourable soil condition affect a plant 's chanc of survival beneath tree . very often the soil be dry and hungry ( deficient in nutrient ) , especially near evergreen and vigorously roote hedge specy such as privet . worke quantity of organic material into the top few inch will marked improve some plant '	performance	. mass conifer cast dense shadow and they fall needle can upset the acid/alkaline balance of the soil . some thinning may be necessary to admit enough light for plant such as rhododendron , pieris and hosta to thrive .
clearly while we do have glider that spin , it be vital to give pilot enough experience to recognise what be happen and to make the right move instead of panick and do nothing . the effect of rain on the stall many pilot be unaware of the significance of dirty wing surface and of rain or drizzle on both the	performance	and the stalle characteristics of glider . test show that on many high performance machine , a spread of splatter fly on the lead edge can account for up to a quarter of the glider 's performance , reduce a glide ratio of 40 : 1 to less than 35 : 1 and make a mockery of glide calculation . this be so serious that for world championship fly , many glider be now fit with a means of clean off the lead edge of the wing in flight .
the effect of rain on the stall many pilot be unaware of the significance of dirty wing surface and of rain or drizzle on both the performance and the stalle characteristics of glider . test show that on many high	performance	, reduce a glide ratio of 40 : 1 to less than 35 : 1 and make a mockery of glide calculation . this be so serious that for world championship fly , many glider be now fit with a means of clean off the lead edge of the wing in flight . in light rain i have measure an increase of about 8 knot in the speed for the pre - stall buffet and stall of a k13 , although the stall it do not seem to have change in character .
after a launch failure of any kind above two or three hundred foot , once the speed have be checke , it be good to turn off 90 or so in order to avoid go far from the field . in this position , the glider be on a base leg for any available field upwind and it be easy to look back and decide whether return to the field be practical . on a normal tow , except for very low	performance	machine , the climb angle of the towplane and glider be much steeper than the glider 's glide angle when fly downwind . so , in theory , the glider should be within easy reach of the glid site . however , in turbulent and windy condition it be always good to play safe and land into wind in another field , rather than to make a downwind landing .
it be alarm to hear how many relative inexperience pilot seem completely unaware of the risk they take when pitt they skills against the force of nature . they often think that if they fly be good enough , it be safe for they to press on in any weather condition . the	performance	of modern glider make it much easy and very likely for a pilot to fly he into a potential death trap unless he use he imagination or have already learn to have a healthy respect for the element . the result have be a noticeable increase in the number of pilot who sudden find they face with a situation far beyond they control , usually a situation that they have not even consider at the start of the flight . in many respect , use wave lift be far safer than cloud fly for attempt at gold and diamond height .
some use ionization detector , which tend to react a little faster to flame fir . other use optical detector , which seem to respond very quickly to smoke from smoulder fir such as that involve upholster furniture . but there be little to choose between the two in term of overall	performance	. look after smoke alarm smoke alarm need very little maintenance , but they do need to be test regularly to make sure they be in good work order .
sudden irritable or moody behaviour combin perhaps with secrecy about movement . a sudden and uncharacteristic decline in school	performance	possibly combin with the start of truancy . what you can do young people be often curious and like to experimend with the late craze .
for fourteen day . i make i pretty busy : get piss , go and screame at jamie , see a million movie , realise with horror that that eat up only a week . a repeat	performance	the next week punctuate by a postcard from l . show the entire sistine chapel ceil on the front , and miss the word love on the back . ho hum . three day before she come back , i clean the flat , buy a new jacket and five bright new cotton shirts , stay sober , work like hell on the magazine in a way that make francis gasp and stretch he eye .
the doctor advise the referee of the injury cause but it be the referee who decide whether the bout should continue . if both contestant be injure through no fault of either , then the bout go to the one with the high score . if the score be tie , then the referee panel will award the victory on the basis of they appraisal of both contestant '	performance	up to the point where injury occur . winn by disqualification a contestant who win because he opponent be disqualify may fight again in the competition .
yet as the competition 's system of elimination proceed , very and very lite performer be bring together , place great pressure on the referee panel . if they then fail to meet this increase demand , distresse confrontation may result . the point i be try to make from all this be that to win a karate bout need two thing you ability to defeat the opponent and the referee panel 's ability to recognise you superior	performance	. the first requirement be in ywe hand , the second be not . one can only hope that tournament sorganise come to recognise this and ensure that each event be staff by the requisite number of official .
stretch the hamstring with progressive , smooth exercise controll stress perhaps one of the great inhibitor of	performance	be fear or anxiety . a certain amount of mental arousal be necessary but too much cause you to lose confidence in you own ability . if you find that you worry about the imagine outcome of the bout and fear the bad or if you have a race pulse , then i would say you be over - arouse and in danger of throw everything away .
you karate school be responsible for nominat you to the open b or regional squad session which be normal hold at little twice a year . ( note that you cannot nominate you for a place . ) a good	performance	in the b or regional squad may bring you to the attention of the national coach , and may also result in you promotion to the lite squad . another way of gette you notice be in the national championship organise by you govern body . some people do well in this but not so well in the squad ( and vice versa ) , presumable because of the different pressure each bring to bear .
fairly soon , the group will be divide up into pair for free sparring . the second session begin with a few limbering - up exercise and then go immediately to the selection . you will fight in up to three bout ( not consecutive ) and you	performance	will be assess by the national coach . you may be ask to fight again in case of drawn bout , and at the end of the session a list of selectee to the lite squad will be read out . do not expect to be select on you first session !
he entrance examination , three month earlier , have show a student of above - average ability , who overall mark average 74.1 per cent , tantamount to a second class honour , call distinction at mcgill . curious , he low mark be in english literature ( a mere 57 per cent ) , though in composition he achie 69 per cent . he	performance	be good in french , where he obtain 71 per cent and 75 per cent in the grammatical and oral examination respective . physics realise 67 per cent ; history a promise 77 per cent ; and mathematics be stron of all , with an average of 77 per cent over three subject : algebra i and i i at 72 per cent and 80 per cent , geometry at 86 per cent and trigonometry at 70 per cent ; ( he admitt to we that he have opt for the latter at school , because it enable he to evade latin ! ) . in chemistry he obtain a splendid 84 per cent .
have vocation advisor be around they would doubtless have recommend a commercial future on the scientific side . certainly he come under such guidance from within he family which clash with he own predilection , for he varsity life seem to have be plague by vocational uncertainty and much than a touch of it weaken indifference . at any rate , they be the good mark that be to appear on he	performance	schedule over the next four year , when he average run at 56.4 per cent . in he own belove english , it be always high , average 71.3 per cent in the three year he offer the subject ; french , which be only offer in he first year produce a convince 75 per cent ; and economics , offer in two year , 62 per cent . philosophy , at 70 per cent , be significan ; but he barely squeeze by in latin , take a refusal at he second attempt and attain a mere pass at the repeat stage ( thank , no doubt , to he past opt out , which necessitate he take latin from scratch at university ) .
make sure manager and supervisor be familiar with the policy and procedure , and make sure too that they set a good example to the staff they supervise . make sure staff know what be expect of they a responsible attitude toward drink , standard of work	performance	and so on . make sure that you employee 's representative be involve all along the line .
a minority of they never go to b at all , but go straight to a and search , like the other , at a visible empty space . until about eighteen month or so they will typically be unable to search for object which have be displace invisible ( by transpose container , for example ) . we need fine - grain theory of why the	performance	break down , theory about memory development ( a sophisticate memory - failure account be still in the running ) , about the ability to inhibit action , about the development of the frontal cortex . but from the perspective of constructivism which be a general theory of how cognisance be possible and how it develop the immediate information - process shortcoming that lead to the failure to relate one 's action to object be not relevant . that infant fail to search in this situations although they clearly have the motor skills to do so be one of the empirical bolster to the view that what develop be the ability to relate action to experience of they ( again : whatever of means in this context ! ) .
that be sure putte it too high . but there be a salience problem here . _ that it be three - year - old who have difficulty with flavell 's appearance - versus - reality problem ; and indeed further experiment have show that there be a strong statistical correlation between	performance	on the appearance - reality and on the false belief task . where be the salience effect i would say that the child be capable very or less of recognize that other people have mental state different to he own .
cognitive neuropsychology case study and group study cognitive neuropsychology be the attempt to draw parallel between model of cognitive function and the pattern of	performance	observe in patients who have suffer brain injury . there be two basic question . first , can we explain the impaired performance that this patients produce in terms of we functional model
cognitive neuropsychology be the attempt to draw parallel between model of cognitive function and the pattern of performance observe in patients who have suffer brain injury . there be two basic question . first , can we explain the impaired	performance	that this patient produce in terms of we functional model second , can we learn anything new about the nature of the underlie cognitive process from study this unfortunate individual cognitive neuropsychology be large a european rather than a north american phenomenon .
the vast bulk of the neuropsychological work perform in the unite states to investigate cognitive processes use group study as in , for example , the investigation of human amnesium ( severe loss of long - term memory function as a result of brain damage ) . a set of amnesics be first assemble on the basis of they low score on a clinical memory test . they	performance	on some task be then evaluate by compare they average score with the average score of a group of match control subject . the purpose be to test an hypothesis about what the cause of amnesium might be . this approach to amnesia have have some success .
in one memorable instance , a patient pronounce listen as liston and respond that be the famous boxer ( marshall and newcombe , 1973 ) . despite they problem with irregular word , however , this patient can produce a plausible pronunciation of unfamiliar non - word ( blasp , for example ) . what might be responsible for such an unusual pattern of	performance	this impairment can be explain in a straightforward manner if one assume that damage have occur to the part of the read system that involve address phonology . this would mean that the patient be heavily reliant on assembled phonology .
in cas of phonological dyslexium , the patient find it almost impossible to read any word with which he or she be unfamiliar prior to brain injury . however they can still read a very high percentage of pre - morbid familiar word accurate , regardless of they spell . this pattern of	performance	suggest that this patients find it difficult to assemble a pronunciation , but they can continue to read familiar word because the lexical system , utilize address phonology , be still work effective . this mean that they be able to retrieve the appropriate pronunciation of a word as a whole from the speech output lexicon . the dual - route model of reading be thus able not only to explain an exist set of data within a simple theoretical model , it also successfully pinpoint the existence of an entire new type of acquired dyslexium .
what they want in future be 32 seed in all the grand slam tournament instead of the 16 they have at present . they argument be that it be good for the tournament , a s well as the player concern , if as many as possible of the high rank competitor survive the early round . they also claim that the player have earn this protection by the	performance	in the rest of the year which have bring about they ranking . in i view , to have 32 seed , even in the man 's single where there be far great depth of talent than among the woman , cannot possible be justify . to have 32 seed in a 128 woman 's single draw , would be nothing less than a protection racket .
the ventoris feature all of the technical system which make the genesis such a successful racquet . the head nodal technology reduce shock to the arm help to prevent injury , whilst the double power wedge strengthen the tip of the racquet , increase pow without lose control . the ventrola tennis shoe be design for comfort and	performance	. it support and stabilize the foot prevent rollover , whilst absorb shock from impact . all this specialist equipment need protection in transit therefore head have introduce a range of luggage for racquet sport , include holdall and racquet bag .
beat the ingham family monopoly be michael calvert ( yorks ) who win the 16 's title 76 46 75 against a tir richard stamp ( linc ) . in the girl 's event , catherine wittenberg ( kent ) , consolidate she position as leader of the reebok 12 and under grand prix table by reach the final , but miss out on maximum point when she lose to claire sewell ( york ) 64 61 . the 16 's final be an all derby affair , in which tina crosen defeate helen frankland 62 63 , whilst the 21 and under title go to lizzie jelf ( oxon ) who outfotch one of we top student player , maggie loughton ( yorks ) 76 46 75 with an excellent	performance	. tenne world instruction hitting with two hands
memory the man first . john mcenroe 's limp first round exit to the russian andrei cherkasov ; ivanisevic 's tepid	performance	that bring deserve defeat against paul haarhuis . then us open champion pete sampra fall at the same hurdle to thierry champion . but it be the 38 year old veteran , jimmy connor , who make the blood come to the boil .
house government allocations to local authority the government have announce plan for local housing authority to compete against each other for part of the money they need to renovate they stock . michael heseltine , secretary of state for the environment , state that from april 1992 , 60 % rather than the current 50 % of government house finance will be allocate on a discretionary basis follow civil servant 's assessment of council '	performance	. the proportion allocate according to a need formula will drop to 40 % . amongst the performance criterium to be take into account when decide allocation will be council 's willingness to involve the private sector in the management and maintenance of it house stock , and the extent of tenant participation in the management of estate .

in the 1970 there be only two type of potential replacement dmu be consider by br 's passenger market people and the engineer . the class 210 diesel - electric design of three - car or four - car unit have actual be produce to a business specification develop in conjunction with the board 's passenger commercial manager . it be intended as a high -	performance	set which could inherit the reliability associate with previous br ( sr ) demus , thus beat the old , inherently unreliable diesel - mechanical multiple unit hand down . it problem , when analys by the new provincial sector be it price : it would cose too much to enable a financial case to be make for the 210 breed to replace exist dmus even take asbesto removal into account . the other design in the offing be the two - axle railbus which have start life as a research division project aim at combin high - speed freightvehicle technology with that of the standard leyland road bus in order to produce a low cost diesel train .
but the new two - axle unit be actual responsible for part of the upsurge in traffic on they route and be certainly no bad than the buse with which they be successfully compet . meanwhile , however , it have become clear that there have to be a replacement dmu which be place midway in size and cost between the railbuse and the 210 unit . but , if underfloor engine and transmission be to be use , they have to be in a different league of reliability and	performance	from the dmu which br have be run since the 1950 . fortunately , some experience have be build up on the european continent , in holland in particular , with dmus which have very reliable and cost - effective engine and transmission . the nederlands railway 3100 and 3200 class unit employ cummin diesel engine with voith hydraulic transmission drive through permanent engage final drive on the axle .
there have even be attempt to stage biographie , one of the first be lor 's billy the kid ( see page 30 ) . choreographer who be inspire to interpret music can do so in many way , all of which can be successful , but only if they remember that it overall rhythm be not mere a mechanical guide to the time of the step within the dance design ( see page 68 ) . the second mean of the word impetus should be apply to the actual	performance	of any step or pose in the purely technical sense . that be , the choreographer must understand from which part of the body impetus be to be give so that the step achieve it full purpose at the proper moment usually in some gesture and it musical emphasis . the moment can be as the dancer paus momentarily in a pose , as a comma in the middle or as a full stop at the end of a sentence .
or the moment can be an important point in an overall design to fill space , such as the moment in a grand jet an avant when the dancer 's two leg be at an equal height from the ground and he or she appear to travel onwards effortless through space . it can also be the moment when a dancer move into a pirouette and spin before hold a pose . however , very important be the third meaning of impetus which have also to do with physical	performance	. impetus be again need , particularly in a story ballet , when it have to be give to emphasise the significance of a step . this always use to happen in old ballet when the hero would take a step forward with a slight stamp before he swore to marry the heroine .
sometimes it be valuable to emphasise the impetus it , particularly if a bravura pirouette be need to display a dancer 's particular expertise or perhaps some exhibitionist trait in the character portray . this can be much effective in cas where the dancer take a slow preparation into a firm but slight demi - pli then sudden rise and turn five or six time . this kind of bravura	performance	be only legitimate if the context and music allow the dancer to steal a little time . much classical choreographer still use this device when work with nineteen - century ballet music , which be often write to order by a composer understand the choreographer 's desire to show off a dancer . since the day of diaghilev and he commissioning of score exclusive to one ballet from such composer as stravinsky , this pander to technical prowess have rare happen .
the above definition may at first seem to have little to do with a choreographer 's work . but if the choreographer do not understand all the detail which go to make the total presentation of a ballet , it can all too easy fail in some way or other . mere to count all the detail that it be necessary to accumulate from the preparation of a scenario and score through rehearsal to public	performance	should make it clear that co - operation from other artist as well as from dancer be require . there must be a librettist if the choreographer do not plan out the plot a composer or arranger of music , a designer for set and costume and all that associate with set and props , painte stage - manage , light and everything else need to get the curtain up . an understand of mass in choreographic term only mean how to organise and manipulate the dancer within that mass of object .
in every enchanement each step an/or pose must be give it appropriate value by way of begin , climax and end so that it place be justify by it importance to the whole sentence . this do not mean that today 's choreographer need follow the convention lay down by the renaissance scholar who be very interested in the physical ability and behaviour of courtier . they be not creative artist but they be and still remain for the much part arbiter of technique and the nicety of perfect	performance	. the originality of so much of ashton 's and macmillan 's choreography fur classical ballet lie in the way they follow the basic principle and rule in order to create an infinite variety of enchanement from the traditional vocabulary of step , and yet discard the convention . birthday offer ashton 's technical virtuosity ( the royal ballet )
so explicit be the tiny gesture and the perfect tim of exit and entrance that the audience be force to recognise the personal tragedy of a love that speak no word . although macmillan 's choreography fur both the above ballet be base on classical technique , it in no way conform to the old school of dance or conventional mime . to portray specific character , whether imagine or real ( some be know to member of the audience at the first	performance	of enigma variation and isadora ) , the would - be choreographer can use classical dance as a firm base but must pay much attention to he character as particular individual . they live and work in a much vary , often plebeian , environment than that of courtier in the palace of a prince . the latter , after all , be the stereotype setting fur all classical ballet until 1789 , the year of the french revolution .
petipa attempt this in the daughter of pharaoh . this type of choreography be take up by late music - hall act who very eccentric soft shoe , sand dance before a background of pyramid and palm tree arouse much laughter . however when fokine stage a night of egypt ( late cleopatra ) he go a great deal far and develope a much particular eastern style inspire by the	performance	of some siamese dancer . he start by sketch numerous fresco and statuette he find in the hermitage museum , leningrad . from such idea he form dance which do away with pointe but retain much of the classical footwork which he co - ordinate with the less familiar action of the arm and hand .
ashton and macmillan do show that change can be make . to take only one example , they use of the arabesque as a gesture . it style of	performance	and expression change repeated throughout each ballet as the dancer change with the attendant circumstance . the arabesque as a gesture change to give some insight into the character 's mood , emotion and action , as well as arise out of the rhythmic and melodic phrasing of the music . there be an obvious contrast in ashton 's enigma variation between the youthful dorabella 's playful and love arabesque in front of elgar and the arabesque of he wife , which be calm and tenderly sympathetic when she dance with he .
nor have any of they have to respond so intensely to he wish . yet the discipline of macmillan 's design in all it variety , dimension and structure require each dancer to understand and conform to technical discipline . it be this which make the	performance	capable of repetition . a comparison of rudolf 's apparently undisciplined emotion with the subtle feeling express by bratfisch , he valet , show how macmillan create some relief even within the decadence and horror . natural emotional expression
she late show she mettle as a clog dancer abet by four pretty girl , try to set she cap at father thoma , but final realise she cannot frustrate true love and dance out happy with the rest . this english pantomime tradition ashton also exploit early in he choreography for the ugly sister in cinderella where he follow the tradition that one be always a somewhat modest violet boss about by she dragon of a sister . this double characterisation be make very hilarious at the first	performance	when the bossy one be dance by helpmann , and late the tall macmillan , with wonderful extend dvelopp , and the shyer one by ashton with dainty attempt to be correct at all cost . a similar incongruous match of the very tall girl with one of the shorte boy in macmillan 's elite syncopation reveal that he , too , understand that old music - hall and pantomime practice be a wonderful source of inspiration if a british audience be to laugh and enjoy the occasion as the dancer do . another commedium dell'arte character who play have influence too few choreographer be that of harlequin , a maker of mischief , a magicker of spell , an animal impersonator and always a great dancer .
both ashton and macmillan take the technical aspect of they choreography very serious . they know that just one small slip can make a joke in dance . moreover , the dancer involve have to take this type of	performance	very serious , even though they must be able to toss off the mistake with an air of surprised innocence . character in national ballet the above approach towards any type of character role be a very typically english trait and have be use in music hall , pantomime and comedy fur many year .
the great dancer antonio be unable to match massine 's design even though each member of antonio 's company dance as to the manner bear . antonio be a star dancer and he could not take an objective view of the whole . he design focuse on he brilliant	performance	of the various solo but otherwise fill the stage with authentic step which play little part in make the action unfold . cinderella ashton and english pantomime tradition shoe fit ( david bintley , deryck rencher , jonathan cope ) means of expression
sure this term should be use to describe someone who life and work or draw the dole in scouserpool when last sight , mccartney be live in the soft south , several hundred mile from he natal city . he do , however , make a brief appearance in scouseland this summer for the premiere , and so far only ,	performance	of he oratorio in the anglican cathedral , he first serious musical work since rupert and the frog song . twitbread new far regale i with the information that mccartney be vote scouseperson of the year by the people of he home city . unlike serious pollster , the brewer 's flaccid organ fail to report the size of the sample of scouser interviewe but it be believe to be adjacent to the number of fan at a tranmere rover away match .
excellent climb can be combin with a family holiday in beautiful surrounding , with a virtual guarantee of sunshine . remember this route be all on limestone , which rare give good route at less than vs , but a line of bolt , end at a firmly anchore chain , up dry and solid rock , mean that a much bolder approach can be adopt than on the polished , easy route of stoney or the vertical scree of swanage . clim outside the usual circuit of the pass , the lake , stanage etc can be a real boost to you enjoyment and , i think , to you	performance	. it be difficult to equate french and british grade . the receive wisdo be that you knock off two letter from the french ; so 5c become british 5a .

patio door be make in timber , aluminium and plastic ( unplasticised polyvinyl chloride , or upvc for short ) . this material be sometimes use in combination aluminium door may be set in a timber sub - frame , for example , and upvc door usually have steel reinforcement inside they box section for extra strength . timber door be usually make either from preservativetreate softwood , or a rot - resistant hardwood such as mahogany , and many have high -	performance	specification that include integral weather - stripp and seal - unight double glaze . they advantage be : wood be an excellent insulator .
wand general , and wooden window in particular , be prone to rot . test the surface for sponginess by pro it with a screwdriver and renow rotten timber either by replace complete section with new preservative - treat wood , or by cut - in new section of wood , or if the area of rot be not too extensive , by replace the decay use a modern wood repair system as make by ronseal and cuprinol . the basis of both this system be a wood hardener which strengthen the decay wood fibre , and a two - part high	performance	wood filler . in both cas , the wood should be as dry as possible when the wood hardener be apply , and when this be dry , the two - part epoxy - resin wood filler be press into the cavity to give a noncrack , non - shrink repair . a sander will be require to remove excess filler and shape it to match the exist timber .
perhaps it be because we human tend to associate protein with fitness and athleticism . who know the fact be there be no real evidence to suggest high - protein diet improve	performance	or be likely to prevent weight loss in work dog . the good news be that you be not on you own ; many owner share you problem . i quite often see underweight dog in i surgery .
a 640 by 480 pixel 16 colour screen have 307 , 200 pixel , each descri by four bit , thus require 153.6 kbyte of storage . so bit image file frequently use data compression . since data compression rely on redundancy in the information to be compress ,	performance	be affect by the nature of the data . there be various method which can be use for computer file ( see box get quart into pint pot ) . run length limitation ( rll ) be probably the much common for bit image file , although the lzw algorithm be also in use .

when the new version of the c compiler be release , i sincerely hope that motorola do not charge for the update , i also hope it provide an adequate manual not like the scant document which accompany version 1.233 . analog device also have a tarnished image with it c compiler for the adsp - 2101 ; it be not until version 4 that the math runtime library become available surely a little late in the day for a fundamental component . texa instrument , have recognise the wide implication of produce high	performance	processor , have attach great importance to it c compiler and produce they for they tms320c25 and tms320c3x . compiler for the tms320c3x produce high optimised code and be supplie with an extensive range of run - time library facility . documentation be well write and contain detailed information on usage of the function call .
andy gothard return to the alma mater . one might not expect saw a renault 5 in half to constitute part of an electronics research project , but that be what they call it at sub - basement level , below the strand . the renault 2.5 be part of drivage , and ec - funded project intended to assess the	performance	of old driver , and work out what technical advance might be useful to old age group . the project have involve collaboration with the college geography department , and the traffic study centre of the university of groningen , in holland . the car be part of a drive simulator , which use a philip video disc player , in conjunction with an acorn archimedes a440 computer , to project video image onto a screen .
the research should help quantify the difference between old and young driver . so far , 150 have be test , and the full statistical result will be available soon . the research team 's david fraser say that preliminary result indicate that the range of drive	performance	be age independent , far outstripp variation between group . so next time you be stick in you car behind that little old lady 's austin 1100 , remember , statistically , she be probably no worse a driver than the 20 - year - old in the porsche which be about to overtake you both . the sound of fractal

i view about the matsushita response be simply that the japanese higher education system general require knowledge of english , which seem at odd with the technics explanation . the basic variation in the technics circuit arrangement have necessitate a set - up procedure , not present in i circuit . furthermore , i own analysis of the technics arrangement suggest that it be sensitive to loudspeaker impedance variation ; under some conditions the	performance	be bad with the subsidiary amplifier than it would be without it . at the same time , even when the circuit perform good at some loudspeaker impedance than the traditional class b circuit , it still have bad performance than that of class s because of the low , yet vary impedance see by the main voltage amplify for all loudspeaker impedance bar one . analyse

move - iron and reed type be produce in dozen of variant , in addition to the odd - ball kind like the compress - air type , but the breakthrough came with the moving coil , which have be modernise from it siemen 1874 patent and lodge 's 1898 one by rice and kellogg in 1924 . the four picture show a magnificent affair make by paul voigt , which have twin diaphragm and 20kilogauss field magnet . it be possibly the first time the bbc have have to take other equipment out of service because someone ( voigt ) complain of it bad	performance	, which have show up on this speaker . if proof be need of the new - find fascination with sound reproduction in the 1950 , the last picture should supply it . it be of one of the unforgettable demonstration by g.a .
it also bring a delicate blush to the bbc cheek . first rc - couple amplify , constructional detail of which be publish by ww in 1923 , bring murd to the heart of transform maker in the land . walter cock 's everyman four trf receiver , which set a standard of	performance	for the rest to try to emulate . one be now in the science museum . everyman four and ( below ) the original circuit diagram
this must seem a promise start for rds for which first receiver appeare only in 1987 . consumer wary of poor performance broadcaster have be no too happy with	performance	of some of the early set . mark saunder ( bbc radio ) in a personal review of design requirement for rds car radio point out that one of the problem that rds pose for both broadcaster and receiver manufacturer be that , with the exception of obvious feature such as the display of the programme service name , an rds receiver be not apparently different in performance , or look , when observe in the static environment of the dealer 's showroom . so from the point of view of the consumer , there be few test that can be do prior to purchase , to ascertain how well a product will perform when fit into the car .
so from the point of view of the consumer , there be few test that can be do prior to purchase , to ascertain how well a product will perform when fit into the car . he say that it be a sad fact that many early rds receiver fail to perform even basic task adequately , and many people have be put off rds for life because of : experience with receiver that perform inadequately and which fail to live up to the promise the broadcaster make for they . mr saunder go on to admit that broadcaster be not entire blameless in this respect : very should no doubt have be do at an early stage in development of rds to give the receiver manufactur industry some guideline set out the minimum level of rds	performance	that should be achie . he belief be that it be preferable if the rf tuner and rds process stage of the receiver be continuously active whenever the vehicle ignition be switch on . the on/off switch on the front panel should only control the power amplifier and display function .
admitted , condition in the american academy be a little tighter than they once be , but what look like stringency by american standard be still lavishness by british one . britain can never hope to compete with all this . nevertheless , professionalism on american line be still the ideal that academic administrator uphold , since it can indicate to sceptical politician and the public at large that university be engage in the visible activity which generate	performance	- indicator . in this climate , the academic in english and other subject in the humanity , who be busy , who publish a lot , who go to conference , cannot but be prefer to the quiet scholar , who keep a low profile , even seem rather idle , but be take he time over a major piece of scholarly write that may involve many year 's work and which he do not intend to give to the world until he be ready . such people have in the past be leave to go they own way without interference .
in this climate , the academic in english and other subject in the humanity , who be busy , who publish a lot , who go to conference , cannot but be prefer to the quiet scholar , who keep a low profile , even seem rather idle , but be take he time over a major piece of scholarly write that may involve many year 's work and which he do not intend to give to the world until he be ready . such people have in the past be leave to go they own way without interference . nowadays they may be esteem by they peer who know something of they work , but this esteey have little currency value in the committee - room where	performance	be appraise . this academics may be respecte , but they be also regard as tiresome . the culture of science look for rapid and visible result , and it be this , despite occasional formal disavowal , that be set the agenda .
academics in english be slone reluctan to engage in team project or pull together in research centre . they can be irritatingly slow to publish , and it be often difficult to know how they spend they time . on the bright side , there be that young and much active lecturer who do they duty and generate	performance	- indicator in the form of book and article . it be true that in some cas this publication may be of extreme radical tendency , attack the establish practice of academic english teach , but that be no objection , since it be the fact of publication that count , not it content . the real problem be that the writer of such text may make political difficulty within a department , or teach in way difficult for student to understand .
the discussion may be restrict to impeccable intellectual topics , but the play of market force be go on all the time just below the surface . in one sense , everyone benefit from the buoyancy of academic book publish . the academic get the publication record that lead to tenure or advancement , and he or she name become know in the profession ; the institution gain	performance	- indicator ; and the publisher keep a full and interesting list . it be hard to speak against a situation that make everyone happy , but one have to say it represent a form of intellectual inflation that be just as pernicious in it way as monetary inflation . far too many inferior or unnecessary academic book be publish each year .
for pound may have be wrong in select fascist italy as the modern society than come near to satisfy he ruskinian demand , and yet right in think that society should be judge according as they meet , or fail to meet , that standard . that he go gross wrong in apply the standard do not mean that the standard as such be inapplicable . however , many of we either no long want to believe in the ruskinian and poundian relation between craftsmanlike	performance	and civic health , or else we tell we ( perhaps with pound 's fate before we as a cautionary tale ) that we can no long afford to believe it . we be only just begin to recognize that if we take this attitude , we be deny to art and letter , and to the criticism of they , any bear at all on public life include , for instance , public education . at any rate , though we would many of we like to maintain that pound 's fascism be a quite distinct issue from pound 's poetry and he criticism , it be plain that we cannot do this .
this presume death be the only unequivocal event in the whole work , however , and there be moments where it meditative air threaten to become baffle introspective . burrow seem to have li with he material for so long that he have forget to throw out enough clue for the rest of we , and there be few hint as to why certain sequence be so important that they should be repeat over and over again but what constant save the piece from disappear into it be the oblique move nature of the central relationship and some patchy but startle lovely dance image . the	performance	too be excellent , with all six dancer ( from the royal ) sensitively adapt to the small scale of the place ( no stagy projection or glaze expression ) . bristow and trevitt never waver in the closeness of they mutual dialogue and move easy between forceful classical dynamics and quiet self - containment . at 40 minute this be an odd but oddly engrosse private journey .
opera north 's tosca , first produce last year , be revive with a new conductor and two new principal , once again heade by the flame - hair tosca of mary jane johnson . if it dramatic focus seem different , it be because carlo rizzi 's tempi be rather faster than that adopt by clive timm ; the action progress less with inexorability than by abrupt shift of mood . perhaps not every chord be quite in place , but this remain orchestrally an exci	performance	; occasional poor balance between voice and stage emanate , i think , from the acoustic property of the set . johnson remain nearly ideal as the jealous , mercurial prima donna . she powerful and eloquent sing really do not need to be supplement by low - register sprechstimme ; one can see the point , but puccini be near enough to raw melodrama without such mannerism .
there be no sign of be unprepar in he typically confident sing , audible even at the end of act one . he already have a conception of scarpia , a cunning brute who veer from calculate anger to cool appraisal of tosca 's bottom while she lover be be torture . one must hope that maxwell will be well enough to assume the role next week , but meanwhile the company be to be congratulate on replace he with so sterl a	performance	by this seasoned professional . edmund barham make cavaradossi almost as formidable , a convince aristocrat , tender with tosca , arrogant with scarpia , and sing with true tone and great power . among minor role i enjoy roger bryson 's fussy sacristan , set the scene of pious hypocrisy by light up during the angelus .
at this level , eight game be too few to allow any margin for error ( in world championship match , they play 24 ) . but with each loser take home about 28 , 000 in prize money courtesy of pilkington glass , even the underdog could afford to be a little much cheerful . as if deliberately to disconcert the semi - finalist , the world champion , garry kasparov , have register one of he many impressive	performance	. with one round still to play in the interpolis tournament in tilburg , holland , he be already sure of first place . nine win and four draw from thirteen game give he a score of 11 point , three point ahead of viktor korchnoi in second place .
the crowd have swoll to about 70 by now , stand in a respectful arc , as if the stage be protect by a sci - fi forcefield . a couple of girl dance enthusiastically and several other tap they foot . a friend of the band weave in and out of the crowd , record they	performance	on a video camera . it be the only indication , apart from the price of the beer , that this be not a decade ago . for the player , there be the prospect of return to they day job with 50 in they pocket , for the landlord there be a healthy night 's taking and for the crowd , even tho who have stay in the bar all evening , there be a nasty ring in the ear the next morning .
thermocouple at critical point in each fridge or other piece of equipment will show , through a computer print - out , how the temperature vary inside it . other item on test include the cold box in which vaccine be carry to village , steriliser for the syringe , stove for the steriliser and thermometer . the outcome of the test be to be a book of approved equipment , with detail of	performance	, publish by who and unicef . an obvious snag be the power cut which be common in third world country . the crl tackl this problem a few year ago , develope ice - lin refrigerator : tube of water surround the fridge compartment freeze ; if the power fail , the tube keep the vaccine cool until all the ice have melt .
the ferrari of gerhard berger finish second , 26 second ahead of alain prost 's mcla . prost 's result do little to far he cause in the championship if he have to drop he low score but senna now know that he must win the final two race in japan and australia . prost , meanwhile , can do no very and the pressure be now with he team - mate to repeat yesterday 's	performance	. while senna 's steady but swift progress make he 20 grand prix victory look easy , the reign world champion say this race have be one of the toughest . this be a very difficult circuit , senna say .
the only consolation be a crowd at the harvey hadden stadium of 2,581 , boost by visite fan . in a bad - temper match , jason ramshaw , the halifax hooker , have he jaw break , while he team - mate richard fairbank and nottingham 's craig whitehead be send off . remarkable , halifax 's	performance	mean that the first division leader wigan , 66 - 0 winner in a 12 - try romp at barrow , be not the day 's top scorer . steve clayton 's eighth - minute dismissal for tripp hardly enhance the home team 's prospect . hull end they four - game lose streak by beat leeds 8 - 7 at the boulevard .
whitaker , the european champion , ride the same three horse as last year next milton , gammon and hopscotch . milton be three 1988 victories include the winner - take - all prize of 25 , 000 in the first running of the next international master , which will be stage again on friday evening . this evening 's ope	performance	begin with the final of the first olympic star spotter championship , which aim to give rider of young horse the chance to test they potential star . the idea have be warm welcome by david broome , who have qualify paul schockemohle 's seven - year - old lotus for this evening 's contest . new zealand 's dual olympic three - day event champion , mark todd , will also be in action on he late kiwi import , double take .
digression win well enough , but the big minus factor against he be the fact that he be by the american stallion , seattle slew , who progeny have tend not to train on over here . sheikh mohammed 's bridal toast , who finish powerfully to take second place could have much scope to progress as a derby contender . fascinate though they be , thought of classic confrontation to come be put on to the back - burner by another dazzling	performance	from zilzal , who stamp he as one of the outstand miler of recent year with a thrashing of the french champion , polish precedent . walter swinburn find it hard to believe zilzal will ever be beat and the son of nureyev will attempt to extend he sequence to six out of six in next month 's breeder ' cup mile in florida . the good news be that he will not be rush off to stud afterward and will campaign for further honour next year when a move up to a mile and a quarter might be consider .
the main problem be the large , virtually all black cast chorus , child and all . colou - blind cast would be as pointless as translate the libretto into home county english . so if , as seem like , we have to wait a long time for a follow up to the triumphant glyndebourne production , we should be all the very grateful for occasion like the royal liverpool philharmonic orchestra 's concert	performance	( sponsore by english estates ) . as it happen , the problem of an unstaged porgy be hardly less acute a cast of 24 soloist and a duration of three and a quarter hour be not easy manage in the concert hall . doubl up role and cut up to two fifth of the score may be practical necessity , but weake the impact of the whole .
the hundred group recommend that nationalised industry should be allow to borrow without government guarantee and that the borrowing should be exclude from the psbr . edward weiss , chairman of the report 's work party , say the recommendations be be put forward as an alternative to privatisation . if the objective of privatisation be to improve management	performance	, it can be achie in way other than all - out privatisation , he say . the black and white approach use in this country , where a company be either wholly in the public sector or wholly in the private sector , be not mirrore on the continent . the fundamental problem with state - owned industry be that they be ration of capital .

as a young doctor in leiden he pay a seminal visit to the neuroanatomist wjh nauta , at that time develope a revolutionary anatomical technique for investigat the nervous system by stain degenerat fibre cut off from they parent cell - body . skuype be the first to use this technique in study of the brain and over the next 10 year , now in the unite states , he chart at a new level of detail the connection make by the cerebral cortex with nervous element in the brain - stem and spinal cord that control movement in a number of high mammal . kuyper then start a long series of collaborative study in which injury to some of this connection in the monkey 's brain be correlate with the defect they produce in	performance	of movements ; the poise of an arm , for instance , to carry out an operation with the finger could be dissociate from the ability to use the finger skilfully . this study continue , with increase sophistication , after he return to europe in 1966 as professor of anatomy at the new erasmus university in rotterdam . he show that injury to connection within the cerebral cortex could cause the dissociation of hand movement guide by vision from that guide by touch .
but the equal pay and opportunity act , introduce in scotland in 1975 , change all that . or be mean to . above the rank of inspector , promotion be a matter of	performance	and much tellingly , other senior ( male ) officer 's assessment . there be time , as mhoira once wryly remark , when she wish she could join the masons or even use the gent 's lavatory . mhoira robertson do take up golf , which become she favourite pastime , and eventually the promotion come , first as director of study and chief inspector at tulliallan police college and final in 1987 as superintendent within the lothian and border force .

todd eldredge , the 18 - year - old form world junior champion , skate superble to take the overall lead after the original programme at the skate electric uk international at richmond ice rink last night . the american , who have be lie second after the morning 's compulsory figure , be place first by all nine judge for both technical merit and presentation . eldredge be	performance	take he past grzegorz filipowski . the pole be first in the compulsory figure but could finish only third in the original programme , behind both eldredge , and vladimir petrenko of the soviet union , in a nine - strong field . britain be two skater , the welsh - base steven cousin and john martin , the scottish champion from ayr , be both outclass .
we want revenge and i think we all feel the pressure because we want to win so bad , say wood , who look very like she be enjoy he . in contrast , at time durie look ready to scream , especially when the error start cree in during the second set of she 6 - 2 , 7 - 6 win over the promise yayuk basuki . indeed , it be something of a typically topsy - turvy but none the less gritty	performance	from durie , who miss a match point at 5 - 3 and then have to wait an hour to complete the encounter after rain fall at the end of the ninth game . she complete victory by take the tiebreak 7 - 5 but not before she lose she serve to 5 - 5 and then save a set point at 5 - 6 . such be the importance place on the result by the player they that team manage sue mappin feel she be able to describe the win as a huge boost .
this ill - advise conceit cast a pall on the piece from the outset , and it do not help that the skit ( rewrite and reconstruct ) be crushingly unfunny . but the trouble , you feel , lie with belushi . it may be that he gift lie in the thrill and risk of live	performance	, lose they savour in aspic ; or , very likely , that he genius be always over - rate . wired purport to be about america not just belushi , but this be trite stuff about decadence in tinseltown ; what it have to say about the nation be nugatory , unless you count a depresse scene in which an audience collapse in laughter while the voice of it generation ( as bluto in animal house ) stuff a sandwich down he pant . belushi be a book , believe woodward , but one be inclined to agree with the cop who pronounce he just another fat junkie who go bel - up .
rather , the story act as a framework for a series of ornamental tour de force . the mime and dance be throughout spectacular , a delight to the eye . the	performance	of durga lal in the title role be a masterpiece of versatility and concentration : he delirium at the end of the first act be nothing short of hair - raise . to say that the recipe be naive would be to miss the point , but with the predominance of so much dance , drama be often lack . for instance , the death of ghanashyam be , frankly , anticlimactic with many of the emphasis thrown onto the lovely succeed threnodic dance .

in the last minute , bernie gallacher , the villa full - back , denie wolf the chance of extra time when he heade shane westley 's header from under the bar . wolf have now fail to progress beyond the second round since they win the then league cup in 1980 . if the result be not one for graham turner to celebrate on the third anniversary of he takeover at wolf , the manner of they	performance	should certainly cheer he on he 42nd birthday today . it take wolf 15 second to bring a black country barrage from the stand with they first , boom aerial pass for bull to pursue ; a further 30 second for villa to concede a corner ; and two minute for nigel spink to be force into a sprawling save by mark venus . a pass from venus sound like the definitive long - ball game , and villa 's central defender , paul mcgrath and mountfield , do well to defend a series of attack that come out of the night sky .
i have a second x - ray on i injury last week and it show that the crack have heale . i be surprise when the doctor say the injury have go . the england captain , who miss the world cup match with sweden in stockholm last month because of bruised rib , be happy with he	performance	against portsmouth , say : i be please to get through the 90 minute . i be involve in some fair strong tackling and do not feel a thing . now i have another week to get i fitness up to the right level .

regular correspondence with the rever minimalist la monte young introduce he to the dadaist movement fluxus , but by the time he have win a leonard bernstein scholarship to the berkshire school of music in massachusett , i feel i will run i course as far as the avant - garde be concern . the dream ticket to america lead to lou reed 's primitive melody and documentary realism , not john cage . not that that prevent cale from scream at a potted plant sit on he piano , or sudden demolish a table beside he stool with an axe in mid -	performance	. a lot of the thing i do be do for shock value . but when i join the velvet underground , then it become a little bit very subliminal .
the philharmonia carry it off well . the frantic whirl of the outer section frame a warm and full - blood andantino with some clear woodwind play , while the well - handle lowere of dynamic in the final page permit an exhilarat ascent to lyapunov 's noisy end . islamey be followe by a rather quirky	performance	of beethoven 's third piano concerto , in which the soloist be the 22 - year - old olli mustonen , a compatriot of the conductor . comparisons be sometimes draw between this work and mozart 's great k491 concerto in the same key , which beethoven be know to have play and admire . the similarity , however , be mostly in matter of device ( the piano arpeggio in the first movement coda , for example , and the six - eight end of the rondo , tragic in mozart , brilliant in beethoven ) .

striker in the staffordshire senior league be currentle face a weighty problem of similar proportion . sid kelly , who mind the net for table - topp eccleshall , be believe to tip the scale at around 20 stone . the roly - poly goalie make head turn on away ground when he run out , and some of he dive stop have be measure on the richter scale , but he	performance	invariable win respect from opponent and spectator . eccleshall , from a scenic village north - west of the county town , be very accustom to proppe up the league than heade it . last saturday , however , with sid on - song between the stick , they hold stafford ranger 's second stre to a 0 - 0 draw and have yet to lose .

of the great player of she day , jane austen wrote only that we be quite satisfy with mr kean , which may not look so good splash across the marquee but which be all many of the expert demand : as far as miss austen be concern , he do not get in the way of the drama . if we be honest , many of we reviewer prefer to engage in a dialogue with the author and director , address concept of political theatre rather than the actor 's little trick of twitch he left ear . so , we bang on about the play and the stage and the big theme , and , if there be any space leave , then , as the chairman of critic ' forum wearily intone , i suppose we ought to say something about the	performance	. in he own solo , edward petherbridge quote james agate 's comparison of actor with puppet : punch and judy have no understanding of they show . what good way for the hired hand to disprive the notion than to dispense with writer and stager entire
so , the star compile and write the evening , and call in a fellow thesp to direct : petherbridge 's the eight o 'clock muse be stage by peter barkworth , john session 's napoleon the american story by kenneth branagh ( a promise young actor , in case you have not hear ) . in both this show , there be an odd sense of be in some sort of parallel universe : it all look the same , but the pow structure have be weird distort . petherbridge mention chekhov and shakespeare , but , for he , theatre be something make by	performance	not write . that be character , he say , after do a few undulation . truly it be .
fourteen percussionist here have a stage of they own , stretch around half of the choir seat , and the average decibel count from the brass be well up in proportion . the concern , though , be always with where the music be go and which of it layer be propell it , so that the occasional sudden stillness become a real opening - up of another dimension in the music 's working and vision , not just a refuelle stop for the orchestra . thrill with think : this astonish piece be necessarily a rare event , and it would be a shame if so astute a	performance	go unrevive . if 's three place in new england also have a philosophical , meditative character , rather than a passionate or temperamental one . the march tune heap up with proper brashness and a wild final acceleration , but the collage until then keep a rare sense of harmonic direction .
turnage have produce a work which be attractive , disturb and memorable : an impressive curtain - raiser to a three - year association with the cbso from which much works be destine to flow . the decision to interpose stravinsky 's suite no 1 for small orchestra as a kind of buffer zone between beethoven 's leonora no 3 and the turnage be little short of inspire . the stravinsky be a welcome up - beat to the new work and it draw a veil over a	performance	of the overture which apart from a crack final presto be emminently forgettable . brahm ' four symphony , now something of a hardy annual with rattle and the cbso , provide the conclusion . scrutinise this familiar object reveal some untidy detail in the first movement : the performer have not quite solve the problem of what must be one of the cruell opening for an orchestra ever devise .

prestige come in the shape of a mercede with the 240d or stuttgart taxi , command 7, 000 but return unfaile reliability . even if lead level in the atmosphere do not bother you , i be sure you will find the fact that unleaded petrol be 15p cheaper , and that diesel fuel boost mpg by at little a third , much interesting . motor : miles of smile as the diesel come of age : brett fraser on the citroen ax , which soffe fuel economy without much sacrifice in	performance	to driver willing to turn away from the petrol engine by brett fraser back in the bad old day , driver of diesel car be the social outcast of the motor world .
the ax be the small of the citroen range and be available in three - and five - door version . scompute be use extensive during the car 's development , in a successful attempt to make the ax 220lb lighter than the class average . the significance be the boost it give to the ax 's	performance	, particularly in the context of the diesel . here be a diesel - engine car which will out - gin many of it petrol - engine rival . it come close to shame some of it own stable - mate , too , and they be among the swiftest in they class .
overheat and loose valvegear chain , both of which can abruptle extinguish all mechanical life , be it ( avoidable ) weakness . with the wisdom of hindsight , it be easy to see now that the stag 's troublesome v8 , design and inadequately develop in - house by triumph before it merge with leyland , should have be ditch and replace by rover 's proven ex - buick 3.5 - litre v8 ( still use by land - rover , morgan , tvr and other ) that be already on the shelf . in the interest of dependability , many stag have subsequently be convert to rover v8 power , gain in reliability ( and quite possibly in	performance	) what they lose in originality and nose heaviness . a rover - engine stag may well be a good car than one with triumph power , but as a hybrid it will never be so valuable . ford v6 conversion be intrinsically even less desirable though worth consider as a cheap and reliable engine .
far from it . the engine be lovely , lugge delivery ( it be not all bad , you see ) serve as an antidote to frenetic drive . whereas much modern	performance	car encourage aggression through they virulence , the stag suppress it while get there just as quickly . anyone who be not relax and glow with a sense of well - be at the wheel of a good stag should keep they money in the building society . age and mileage have little to do with value any very .
all this scheming take a lot of energy , and mr pozsgay have plenty . he dart around the country in the same blue pin - stripe suit , deliver variation of the same speech . he frequently give interviews , and have get television	performance	down to a fine art . he boyish smile and double chin be now instantly recognise by hungarian and increasingly by foreign viewer . in he spare time he read social science journal and contemporary hungarian literature , or cook for he family or friend .
despite official denial , it appear the us do agree to play a limit , and deniable , role in the rebellion . we officials place much of the blame for the debacle on half - cock rebel tactics , and a lack of adequate advance consultation with washington . but the white house chief of staff , john sununu , have start an inquiry into the administration 's	performance	in one of it first effort in foreign policy crisis management . the administration 's enemy , both on the democratic leave and the republican right , be still circle yesterday hope to draw political blood . in a speech to the senate on thursday night , senator jesse helm compare the us performance to that of the keystone cop .

with the exception of three year in the mid - fifty , rowicki continue as it artistic director and principal conductor until 1977 . for a short period from 1952 to 1954 he be professor of conduct at the warsaw conservatoire . from 1965 to 1970 rowiecki also serve as musical director of the theatr wielki , warsaw 's huge opera and ballet theatre , and preside over the open	performance	of the reconstruct building in 1965 , conduct moniuszko 's straszny dwor ( ' the haunted house ' a characteristically polish mix of folklore and bellinian melody ) . but the exigency of operatic life do not really appeal to one of he perfectionist standard . he prefer tour with he orchestra and , increasingly , guest conduct abroad .
nigel andrew , financial time . in term of performance the film be praiseworthy , with a consistent , naturalistic , undeclamatory style that still respect the poetry kenneth branagh 's own	performance	correct , passionless , all intelligence - will be entirele a matter of taste . david robinson , the time . this henry v be an achievement of some character and resource , wart and all .
it be fair to say that the real chemistry be not between actor and part , but between the idea of the star as entrepreneur and the idea of the k as a self - make man . adam mar - jone , the independent . the good thing about wired be michael chiklis 's touch and convince	performance	in the central role of john belushi . otherwise , there seem little to commend it . the filmic device of a discarnate belushi review he life allow the dead performer ( and hollywood collective ) a right of reply ; unfortunately it also make the film ludicrous .
toshack have waste no time in put he stamp on the side , move the west german midfielder bernd schuster to libero , michel from the right flank to central midfield , and give the striker emilio butragueno a slight withdrawn role . and that with they ear to the dressing - room wall have yet to report rumble . toshack have take pain to play down the hard - man image he bring from san sebastian , swear that the extra training order after the poor	performance	at castellon be not a punishment . while real be unbeat , the relative honeymoon will continue for a man who the late bill shankly , with characteristic caution , once say be destine to become the top manage in the game . toshack 's admiration for shankly , who sign he for liverpool from cardiff in 1970 , be unquestionable deep : still the overwhelm influence on he career .
in water , it split like a spider 's web into gossamer strand while retain it basic strength . many angler be hail it as the much significant advance in fish tackle during the past 20 year and dave chilton , the man who have popularise it use , believe that the line , make from the world 's stron man - make fibre ( lancia use it to strengthen the internal bodywork of it car ) , may revolutionise all branch of the sport . in many part of the world , fish be still be catch by bow and arrow and it be a bowstring which first put chilton , a bolton lorry driver , on to the potential of the high -	performance	polyethylene fibre . he have be experiment with dental floss , which be multi - strand but then break when rub against rocks or weed . i be deliver to industry and keep a constant look - out for a suitable material .
the all white , incidentally , have they own all black date in a fortnight . quin need paul ackford fit to face bedford far much than they do today . he pick up a groin injury during he heroic	performance	in lion colour in france and , with exhaustion probably exacerbat he condition , he make way for david thresher in the second row . the prop andy mullin , like ackford and thresher an england squad member , be another absentee , with a twisted ankle . brian moore , the lion hooker , make he first appearance of the season - have rest since the tour of australia for nottingham at northampton .

it be relative easy to operate such a system where trade be involve and many be in specialist grade as in she majesty 's stationery office , the up - and - run agency with the much sophisticate pay arrangement so far . offer it to army of administrative assistants do non - commercial job in the great clerical factories underpinn the benefit system and in a nation - wide network of local office , be another matter . they be look at job - weight , concept of stewardship and	performance	measurement in the knowledge that great flexibility in pay ( and recruitment ) will be crucial factor in escape from what mr montagu call the rigidity that have bedevill we in the past . the feasibility study prepare by stephen hickey , an assistant secretary , which provide the agency blueprint for the dss , be unequivocal about the key asset in the operation people will represent the prime resource of any social security agency and blunt in say morale in some area be low virtually no local office staff be happy to admit work for social security . mr montagu and mr brown believe get staff not to fear the agency process as a bringer of cut or bad condition , but as a way of improve both and service to the customer , be the crucial task face minister and senior officials between now and spre 1991 .
at a seminar host by the edinburgh concurrent supercomputer project last month , researcher and vendor could final say with confidence that supercomput in the 1990 and beyond will be do by parallel computer . there be fundamental limit to how fast a conventional computer can go . data cannot be move from the processor to the memory and back faster than a certain speed , which limit the	performance	of the computer as a whole . another limitation be the extent to which component can be shrunk before quantum effect decrease they reliability . faced with this problem , computer scientist begin in the mid 1970 to experimend with use many processor in a single machine to work in parallel on a single problem .
still owne by it employee , meiko have break into the american and japanis supercomputer market , and now have office across the us and in europe . the large of it computing surface machine be at the university of edinburgh . face with the loss of they previous high -	performance	computer in 1987 , the university get back from the science and engineer research council and the department of trade and industry to purchase a large computing surface to serve both as a research vehicle and a flagship site for meiko . the edinburgh concurrent supercomputer project ( ecsp ) , under professor david wallace , now have the large parallel computer in europe , with 400 processor which can perform 400 million arithmetical calculation a second . the example of the installation at edinburgh have lead to several million dollar 's worth of business which , according to meiko , would have be much harder to obtain without a such a proof of cost - effectiveness .
the winner may now become glover 's first runner in a group race . he mission have be plan two year ago when he work well with stablemate balthus , the 1987 cambridgeshire winner , and glover promise he have something else in the yard to continue the trend in two year . for the successful jockey , dean mckeown , it be some compensation for the dismal	performance	of 2,000 guinea hope message pad on friday . mckeown have not give up on the north 's hope for next year 's classic , who be find to have a temperature after finish last in the somerville _ stakes . he be get a real motor , but that day the engine fall out , say the jockey .
when you be always try to make you well shot you sometimes miss . in a long match like this it be really difficult to play you well for three and a half hour . lendl 's concern that mecir 's shrewd shot would pass he in mid - court make for a characteristic back - court	performance	and a 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 victory for a 100, 000 ( 62,500 ) prize . while it would be a mistake to regard such matches too serious when they lack the edge of grand prix condition , lendl 's tactical reticence be intereste . mecy could not envisage he fellow czechoslovak change a successful routine .
england 0 australia . . 0 steve taylor probably establish he as the rightful successor to he much famous namesake , ian , when he give an outstand performance of goalkeep in england 's final game in the lada classic at luton yesterday - a goalless draw with the world champion . the result be enough , however , to give australia the trophy . follow they disappoint	performance	against the dutch on saturday when they lose 5 - 1 , england make a number of change , include dropp captain richard leman and introduce a young right - w triangle of chris mayer , russell garcia and rob hill . it be mayou who give the experienced michael york a torrid afternoon and create a string of opportunity with penetrat crosses . only sound keep by lachlan dreher in the australian goal and poor finish deny england a victory they fully deserve .

santiago , chile : on a warm autumn even in 1990 international rock star ste dance on stage with a group of chilean mother and grandmother of the disappear . the event , organize by the chilean section of amnesty international , be entitle an embrace of hope . moscow , ussr : at the same time , 12 , 000 mile away , a delegation from amnesty 's international secretariat be make	plan	for a fledgle moscow group to participate in the woman in the front line campaign . to outsider , the two events may seem little much than an international organization at work , but for amnesty member this event be charge with significance . the cold war be at it height when peter benenson , the british lawyer , founded amnesty , and three decade late it be hard to believe that the moscow ai group final have permission to become part of soviet life .
interpretation be the heading which be the much wide - range of the three element , include question of form or style , but perhaps additionally consider the work 's historical background , and technical , thematic or other question , include the artist 's biography . the evaluation be a summe up which place the work in the experience of the critic , and help the reader to form a judgement . the	plan	of the book , then , be simple . after the first two chapter , it discuss where and how to read art criticism . while this first chapter have outlin what that criticism be , the next give sketch of half a dozen critical type .
the white rabbit have put on he spectacle , but he do not know where to start . begin at the begin , the king say grave , and go on till you come to the end : then stop . many art book follow this	plan	, especially tho aim to take in a national culture or a whole civilisation . art history often make an attempt to keep to chronology , although the difficulty include the crucial fact that in art there be no clear sequence of event . unlike old - fashion narrative history , art have no decisive battle , no international treaty , and no change of government .
sculpture in citie be a part of cultural history , and can be the symbol by which the citie be know or remember . rome be distinguish by the statue on the capitoline hill of marcus aurelius ; new york , even the unite states , be symbolise by the statue of liberty ; copenhagen be remember for it mermaid . also , the history of sculpture include some account of the abortive	plan	for sculpture , just as the history of architecture be incomplete as a history of idea without a knowledge of reject proposal . even though the same might be argue for paint , the technical obstacle to be overcome for paint be very much less than for sculpture . again , this be where sculpture be close align to social and political history .
in the periodic table he mention a woman dear to i heart who be murder at auschwitz : but the book on auschwitz do not discuss he relationship with she . in the wrench he create the rig faussone , the practical man who crane girdle the world and who keep return , a little heavy - foot , to the house in turin where two old aunt fuss over he welfare : faussone be speak of as i alter ego , and the book have to struggle to accommodate he as a second person , available for interview by levi . this omission and transposition indicate that levi could well have keep to he any	plan	he may have form to end he life . during the meet with he a few month before he death which be record in an article publish in the london review , philip roth find he as keen as mustard : here be someone who listen , with the intent stillness of a chipmunk . levi have a high opinion of the grain of mustard , and of salt .
it be basically envisage to be of national proportion as well as non - denominational , with religious instruction give in separate classes . there be , however , controversy from the start . the church of ireland withdraw it school from the	plan	which threaten that church 's dominance over the primary sector . the presbyterian also have misgiving , and only come back into the system in 1838 when they be practically guarantee control of they own school within it . the church of ireland rejoin in 1860 , because it lack fund to continue it own system .
so , wrote harsnet , there be continuity as well as discontinuity , but that do not mean , he wrote , that there exist what be call character , personality , character , goldberg wrote in the margin , personality , as they seem to think , wrote harsnet ( and goldberg go on type ) , when they say you have such a generous character if you would only recognize it , or you have so much to offer , or it be not for i i speak but for you , not for i i mourn but for the waste of all that generosity , when they pour that word over you , character , generosity , warmth , look sad , shedd tear , put on a brave face , say do not pay any attention to i , or , it be nothing , forget it , i be cry for the waste , mean waste if it be not directe towards they , but you have only to see what happen when one let one be persuade by that sort of thing , wrote harsnet , you have only to see what happen to hutchinson , macmahon , rollin and goldberg . take in by the image of you they present you with , wrote harsnet , instead of wait in patience for the begin , instead of wait and then begin , though begin , have begin , he wrote , be not everything , be far from everything . it be quite possible , he wrote , that it will lead nowhere , even when one have begun at the right time in the right spirit , or at little not at the wrong time , in the wrong spirit , with the wrong	plan	and have make the wrong preparation , with the wrong tool and the wrong principle , on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception . though it may well be , he wrote , that one actual achieve very work with the wrong plan and in the wrong spirit , with the wrong tool and the wrong principle , on the wrong surface and with the wrong conception , it may well be , he wrote ( and goldberg type ) , that one achieve very than work with the right plan and in the right spirit , with the right tool and the right principle , on the right surface and with the right conception , though right and wrong and much and little be relative concept and what seem right at one moment to one person may seem wrong at the same moment to another person or at another moment to the same person , and what seem very to one person at one moment may seem less to another person at the same moment or at another moment to the same person , right , wrong , much , little , relative concept , scribble goldberg , in the margin , pant slight as he bend over he old olivetti portable , there be only the begin , wrote harsnet , or rather , there be only have begin , begin , scribble goldberg , aware now of the black stain on he hand leave by the felt - tip pen , have begin , there be only the feeling in the pit of the stomach or the feeling in the chest , wrote harsnet , the feeling of sickness or the feeling of elation , that be not relative , he wrote , that be absolute . yet be it possible to assert , he wrote , that work do with a lift of the heart be good than work do with a contract of the stomach
though it have to be say , he wrote , and goldberg , he eye race down the page cover in he friend 's tiny handwrit , pause to sip from the glass of fresh orange - juice at he side , wipe he forehead and go on type , it have to be say that i have occasionally have the illusion that i know what step to take first and even , occasionally , what step to take second , i will not talk about a third . there be of course no logical reason why thing should be different this time , wrote harsnet , why this too should not be an illusion , the illusion of imagin that i know not only what step to take first but also what step to take second and even what step to take third . no logical reason , he wrote , but that will not make i change i	plan	once i have begin . night , he wrote , work on the big glass and on the note for the big glass , day , sleep and write this freewheele commentary on the entire project , viz . on the big glass and on the note for the big glass . night , scribble goldberg in the margin of he typescript , work on glass , day , work on freewheele commentary .
i need to move slowly across from the left and see where thing start to go wrong , he wrote . except that i cannot work like that . i have make i	plan	and i must stick to they . even in the plan , though , i now realize , he wrote , there be a certain vagueness about the right hand side of both panel . perhaps because in paint as in wri we start from top left hand side , so that the right be always less clear .
except that i cannot work like that . i have make i plan and i must stick to they . even in the	plan	, though , i now realize , he wrote , there be a certain vagueness about the right hand side of both panel . perhaps because in paint as in wri we start from top left hand side , so that the right be always less clear . intereste to examine the old master from that point of view , he wrote .
however , he wrote , for that very reason , the right hand side should have be even very solid , even very think through than the left . but there it be , he wrote . the	plan	be make , work have begin , there be no go back . work as the fancy take i , he wrote . a little bit here , a little bit there .
in other word , he wrote , be i right or wrong to see this as decisive i that an insight into how thing really be , or only one very pass think i	plan	have be well lay , he wrote . the project be well under way . there be no reason to fail .
but in the end very disappoint . as be often the case , some last - minute idea blossom while what have seem a brilliant solution and be ponder for age fall quite flat . that be why there have to be the big glass and the note in the box , not the glass alone or the note alone , but the box , with all i preliminary note and measurement , all i	plan	and blueprint , and then the glass , with the end product of all that note visible on it surface . consider , he wrote . where be the image
not to be sidetrack for any reason whatsoever . not to give in to temptation , no matter what form it take . but difficult at time to remember why i ever make such a	plan	, he wrote . or even if there be any plan at all . or any glass at all .
then : can i see it i take he in and watch as he study it . you have not take up any of that	plan	about the boxing - match , he say . or the waterfall . i stand at the window and look down into the street .
first part over , second part starts . must see it for i in a public space . that be the	plan	. goldberg in guardian today , major new work , still to be unveil , but that who have see it , etc . letter from pizetti , what about moma next year , letter from rosenblum , what about washington after new york , letter from karsten offer hamburg .
there appear to be no creative public vision which will help the survival of the pub or help ensure a healthy and vary pub stock . history , indeed , tend to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforce rather than curb market excess . it be the license system and license control , after all , which help to foster britain 's peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hand of the brewer in the first place ; and it be the same system which connive at and partly encoura the modern contagion of open -	plan	pub design . in addition , the 1989 mmc report , conceive as an attack in the public interest on the monopoly power of the major brewer and require the unty of large chunk of they tied estate , may have devastat consequence for traditional pub . for despite they other shortcoming , much of the major brewer have be able and will to cross - subsidise many less profitable house .
at the saracen 's head at towcester , for example , a recent proposal to historicise the pub involve extensive destruction of genuine historic fabric and the introduction of the bad clich of traditional pub detail , such as bull - eye glass and copper lantern . in recent year serious damage to the historic interior of pub have resulte from the creation of the open - plan which now seem to be pubs ' standard internal layout . often the creation of the open	plan	interior require the removal of wall , chimney breast , stair and other internal feature of interest , which be high destructive of the building 's historic character . the owner of the hollybush at elstree propose to infill an original coach arch in the pub 's facade and to demolish the timber frame side wall of the passageway behind in order to form a large and open interior , even though it be this feature that distinguish the building as an historic inn . in the much extreme cas the exist building be so different from the historic pub concept that a virtual rebuild be propose .
a good example of this can be find in the sleep village of buckland in oxfordshire ! the lamb , a picturesque village pub close some year ago by allied , be reopen in 1989 as a free house after an extensive remodell which involve the complete gutt of the original unexceptional but characterful , partitioned interior . now nothing remain whatsoever of the old fitting , feature or proportion ; in they place be a vast , open -	plan	space with bright white wall , bistro furniture and cheery chintz . a similar treatment be recently mete out by allied 's tetley walker subsidiary to what remain a fundamentally georgian pub in an urban setting near manchester the church inn at lowton . have apply cement render over the external brickwork , attach a hideous modern porch and add an extension in jarr and inappropriate modern material , the brewery designer have gut the interior .
one such example be the grade ii pen and parchment on bridgefoot in stratford - upon - avon , where the barn at the back of the pub be use as a theatre throughout the 18th century . such appropriately stratfordian association have , however , be totally disregard by whitbread in they recent cavalier remodell of the complex . not only be the pub interior they of the nondescript , open -	plan	kind , but the barn to the rear have be wholly mutilate . fortunately , not all recent pub refurbishment have be in this vein . a number of the big brewery have recently make encourag mofe towards a much sympathetic attitude to they historic pub .

the rich variety of pub type create during the 19th century have subsequently be large lose by redevelopment and remodell . this not only make an understand of the nature of victorian pub difficult , but also mean that that which do survive merit special care and attention . one of the much important change in pub design during this period be in the	plan	. pre - victorian pub be large run on the basis of waiter - service , follow from the original concept that the pub be a house open to the public for refreshment hence the term public house . thus the introduction of bar service be a revolution .
thus the introduction of bar service be a revolution . bar service enable various different room , or cabin within room , to be serve from a central point ; many late - victorian pub have a sequence of separate private bar serve from a single bar - counter , in total contrast to the current fashion for single - room pub . the modern desire for open -	plan	have lead to the removal of many bar - partition , destroy the character of original interior and distort any attempt to create a truly victorian interior . the small private bar not only create intimate area within a pub for small group of people , but also enable a wide variety of people to be serve in the same building . a 1907 description of a typical suburban pub with six bar feature omnibus driver and conductor in the four - ale bar , horny hand son of toil and lady customer in the bar opposite , with other woman in the bottle and jug .
the thirtie society have try to counteract the brewer 's failure to understand the potential asset represent by they 20 century building , but since so few pub be list many case escape we notice . the county arm at blaby be subject to a proposal for the as a beefeater steakhouse some year ago , which be reject by the local authority with support from the thirty society although the building be not list . very recently , the prospect inn be threaten by an enlargement scheme by whitbread which would have totally destroy the remain original feature of the building , and it remarkable	plan	. fortunately , the thirtie society be able to get the prospect list in may 1990 , and alternative development plan be await . the prospect inn , which could be restore a major tourist attraction , be also threaten by a road wide proposal by kent county council , although the local authority , thanet , understand it importance and value the building .

the john bull in layerthorpe , york ( b wilson , 1937 ) be a tudor - style pub remarkable solely through have survive unalter , but not listable simply on this ground . the need of pub management in the 1980 have be hard to contain in pub originally segregate into saloon and public bar , if not into further distinct space . this have be the experience of the thirtie society in fight for the retention of the main	plan	feature of the nag 's head , one of the few listed pub of the period . designed as a demonstration of bi - partite segregation between public and saloon , it lend it poor to unification , and the restorable public bar would have be lose in the process . the thirty society negotiate a compromise scheme with the architect act for ind coope which the owner find unnacceptable , threaten closure of the pub .
a much straightforward case be that concern jack straw 's castle , which be list after a scheme be submit to cover the courtyard with a new restaurant . the new emphasis be to be on di rather than drinke , and the design be as sensitive as it could have be . due to the circumstance of the original build , there be some strange anomaly in the	plan	, but the courtyard remain a key part of the design , much enjoy by visitor in the summer , sit under a fine speciman walnut tree . the scheme be take to public inquiry in october 1990 , in which the borough of camden be support by the thirty society and lucy arch , raymond erith 's daughter and biographer . the appeal be dismiss .
good idea : this would extend the tourist season into late summer and autumn and bring britain very into line with it european neighbour . the british tourist authority like it . the government , however , have no immediate	plan	to change the public holiday set - up . the industry have markete britain energetically as a year - round destination , with many attraction that do not leave the visitor at the mercy of we fickle weather . the public holiday should reflect that .

all this little bit and piece be start to add up and i be get nowhere . admitted i be depress again no , not depress exactly , low would be a good word . i	plan	for how i be go to live out the rest of i day have just be tear up in front of i face and i need time to adjust . a little luck would not have come amiss , either . the house be sell very quickly and the new owner immediately give we all notice to quit .
they have become i friend and there be no way that i would now go back to be they problem dependant . i wander back north towards the church . i	plan	be to sit around and wait for one of the parish team to appear and then to ask they for they advice . accordingly , when i arrive there , i settle down in a pew at the back and nod off . after a while , i be wake by the noise of preparation something happen .
it would probably be good if i start from square one , the contact opened the proceedings by say . someone have leave we a private house in colchester in they will and we have decide to use it as a training house . it be only just be finish but the	plan	be to have four people live there three clients or whatever and one person sponsore by we , probably a member of staff . everyone have they own room with a little fridge and a kettle , but you do have to share kitchen and bathroom . what role do you member of staff have in all this
the calcareous clay , such as east anglian boulder clay , be alkaline and therefore will not suit azalea or rhododendron . but the acid or neutral clay which be find in many part of britain be as good for lime hater be be acid sand . plant	plan	desig a beautiful garden be no much difficult on clay than anywhere else . for a formal theme , neat - grow tree such as the clay - love acer can be plant at regular interval along a brick path to create a little avenue .
once plant , and whether 10 or 50ft high , a tree become a focal point around which to build a complete plant community . under natural condition a tree grow in a hedgerow , copse or for progress through various stage of settlement to a climatic climax which , once attain , remain the same year after year with only minor variation . contrived plant	plan	this process , which can take several decade in open country , may be contrive in only a few year in a garden by reverse the natural scheme of thing . first plant the tree or tree , follow by shrub careful select for they usefulness in support a diverse wildlife community .
by blanket the soil they also help to control weed . leguminous green manure , such as clover and bean , fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil by means of they root nodule , so make it available to plant late in the grow season . include the plant of a green manure into a garden	plan	can seem difficult . the easi way to start be to sow small patche when cleare crop in autumn . of course , if for any reason you have to leave you garden for several month , the good thing you can do be to sow a suitable green manure .

such incident can only be avoid if the pilot have a much open mind about where he be go to land . for example , if the glider be too low to land conventionally in the normal landing area directly into the wind , it may well be possible to land across wind and behind the normal launch point , so that the low turn can be complet safely . all too often the pilot have a	plan	be no long feasible . it be sometimes quite hard for a person to do the unconventional , but that may be the only safe option . however , if the pilot be think ahead , that option could have already be consider and he could have have the plan ready for use if much height be lose .
it be in this situation that centr skills be much useful . when give instruction in thermal soaring , i try to insist that student go on attempt to find lift until about 5600 foot , and i very often explain i own thought and precaution as they do the fly . all the time during each turn it be essential to have a	plan	for the bad contingency and to know exactly what you would do if you sudden lose 200 foot . in this way it be possible to use the lift low down with safety , provide that the thermal be not too turbulent . then it be necessary to give up much high .
once you have some idea of what would suit you , you will need help to take this idea forward . you can contact you social service occupational therapist at you local social service office address at the end of the book . help with	plan	. who do i ask it will be necessary for you to seek help and advice from someone who know about building and plan .

ho circular ( 194/78 ) describe british and american research literature on policing be another typically apologetic , anti - intellectual document , for within it first few paragraph it admit : the implication of attempt to establish a central research information centre to give advice to chief officer about research finding , or collect , collate and distribute research of inter to the police service , and maintain an up - to - date index of research would be very considerable . there be no	plan	to establish such a centre . no one seem to have ask whether the staff college could have take on this job , but then again such anti - intellectualism be apparend even in the bramshill scholar 's association . in 1985 , they propose to extend they role beyond that of an annual dining club for officer who have take a degree through the police college scheme .
he talk enthusiastically about get back to some real police work in the real world , even though he responsibility as divisional commander will be mainly administrative and give he little or no contact with the dangerous classes . we take the piss out of he , because of this idea that he will be do real police work , but we all know that divisional work have high status for a chief supt . than research , and this be the cause for celebration . within 3 day of he successor 's arrival , we have a dept . meet where we new chief superintendent outline he	plan	. in a run down on the style of deference he anticipate ( which i note will stifle any critical point from below deck ) , he talk about he length of tenure and how long it will be before he can escape back into the real world . the research manage ( a civvy ) who be aware of i research interest grin across the room as this desire to escape back into real work be reinforce by yet another chief supt .

associationism be long dead as a theory of think , but externalism remain as a feature of many of it naturalistic successor , because , by virtue of they naturalism , they can find no space for intrinsic generality of mental contents . the problem for the associationalist be exactly mirrore in that theory of think and mind inspire by computer and artificial intelligence . the human mind which , from this viewpoint , be the brain be say to work on the same	plan	as a computer , with operations be carry out on physical symbol . the question be , what give this symbol mean the answer be that , as with associationism , they mean come from they relation to thing external to they .

why do face loom up in this way how be it that eye or mouth or the much fleet expression , the mere muscular twitch , rise unbide to an otherwise fully occupy mind sheep in a	shelter	, a pig on a bench , a woman on the well - stone , two man swing they leg : why be they so persistent , why be they linke together this must be what be call hypnogogic image , the strangely potent montage which come at a mind already lapse into a sort of sleep . i cannot yet rest .
let we relax , then . let we blow smoke at each other , you and i . a long way from here the amiable and taggled sheep be still curl together in the roadside bus	shelter	and the wind still move through the unclad tree . in about an hour , i suppose , it will be daw there , too . a faint glow of orange push through the stalky horizon .
he have never understand the old joke . but sandra be think of sheep . a picture come to she of the shaggy wanderer huddl together in the bus	shelter	at the top of the road where she have be bear and bre . it be a cold old night for the animal , she say , exactly duplicat one of she step - father 's regular phras . the other three look at she as though she have speak in an old and now unknown language .
the simpl and saf response be to agree with he , and then find a way of do what you want late . that be why she have two bank accounts and an occasional bruise on she face . across the empty room another hurt mind have be at the same moment of time glance by unwant evocation of shabby for sheep nudge together in a brick	shelter	on a high road through the tree . look at each other , wordless grapple , two people from the same small segment of the country have unknowingly provoke in each other ill - form shape of what use to be home , and as yet unrecognize image of what use to be they . the slow dance be quicken , swirl they back and back through the darken wood and stab gorse of memory to the sheep try to escape the cold night and , beyond that , to the way in which each of they , for girl and for boy , have first joined body with another .
far away across the vary green and brown the wood - jag horizon give way to the faint blue hump of the malvern hill . in the opposite direction , firmer in outline , very clearly separate from the cling of the sky , the darker mountain of wales set the boundary of he vision . sit safe in the big tree , hide within the protective myriad of bough , branch and leaf , he be submerge in a greenish half - light filter through layer upon layer of natural growth , and he be look out from the dimm or dappl	shelter	of he high cave into the dazzle of a rare summer brightness beyond . the boy be not then aware , of course , of how frequently an idling or unanchore mind can be disturb by the accidental experience of receive luminous image from out of clear , sharp light when it be it cast in any sort of shadow . it be physiologically unsettl to gaze out from a dark patch into a bright one .
pig on a bench . start count . sheep in the	shelter	, count they . one two three four five six not yet seven eight nine no no ten eleven twelve wait thirteen fourteen no ! fiftee not yet ! sixteen wait , wait , wait seventeen wait ! seventeen seventeen eighteen no use nineteen the stuff be co - m ! tgo i must have shout out at that precise moment where exultation turn to disgust , the moment of spill , of defilement . a shout loud enough to wake the child .
among the great and good , scarcely a voice could be hear support a proposal which the bbc 's founde father , lord reith , have say would prive as beneficial as dog - race , smallpox or the bubonic plague . the tory party leadership , include churchill ( who think commercial television a tuppenny punch and judy show ) , lord salisbury , sir anthony eden and r a . butler , be unenthusiastic . the leader of the trades union congress , governor of the bbc , the archbishop of york and canterbury , to say nothing of grand figure like the former foreign secretary , lord halifax , the former chancellor and home secretary who give he name to the wartime anderson	shelter	, lord waverley , and the saint lady violet bonham carter be all against . henry fairlie observe : the debate on commercial television remain one of the cleare example of the establishment in action in defence of one of it deare illusion , namely , that it know well what be good for other people .
he do not have to look after a family . if the bad come to the bad in the war , he will leave we all in the mess and put a bullet through he head . a woman in an air - raid	shelter	in schweinfurt , april 1944 if people have imagine in 1933 that thing would have come to such a pitch , they will never have vote for hitler . an anonymous german , march 1945
the view that the war might have be over today be say to be common among woman in country locality . and the report include one directly negative remark . from the darkness of an air - raid	shelter	, a woman 's voice be hear , say : if only they will have get he . the difficultie of reach an unequivocal evaluation of the impact of the bomb - plot on attitudes toward hitler can be see , too , from a consideration of letter of ordinary soldier from the front , where evidence can be find both of a revival , if temporary , of faith in hitler , and of extreme anti - hitler feeling express despite the censorship . the report of the censor for august 1944 , base on an examination of 45 , 000 letter , run :
learn the need of horse be the first step in discovere they emotion , and understand they behaviour . horse , like people , have a number of essential need , both physical and psychological . they physical need be for food , water ,	shelter	from extreme weather , a safe environment , sensory stimulation , light , exercise , and freedom from injury , pain , or parasite . essential psychological need be for companionship of other horse , affection , self - esteem , respect and acceptance by the herd , mental stimulation , and sufficient space . domesticate hors , again like , people , can be condition to have other need too , and can learn to like or want something which would be of no interest to a wild horse .
trough should not be place in the very corner of paddock or yard . they should be place where horse can have free access to they without the fear of be trap and hurt by a much aggressive horse higher in the peck order . it be essential to provide	shelter	for hors to protect they from the extreme of heat , cold , wind , or rain . ( it be also preferable to rug they in cold or wet weather , but they need to be under daily supervision in case the rug slip . ) a desirable size for a shelter shed be about four by four metre , and close on three side .
it be essential to provide shelter for horse to protect they from the extreme of heat , cold , wind , or rain . ( it be also preferable to rug they in cold or wet weather , but they need to be under daily supervision in case the rug slip . ) a desirable size for a	shelter	sh be about four by four metre , and close on three side . it back should be towards the much prevaile wind probably the west , so the shed be open on it east side . shelter tree be also desirable , especially in the summer .
in hilly country , hors always like to spend some of each day on the top of the hill : they need to satisfy they desire for the space and freedom that a hilltop provide . so , if they be paddock low on a hillside , they frequently wear a track with littrestle pacing along the high fence rather than along any other . for this reason , if	shelter	shed be place in a paddock , they may have to be place at the top of the hill and preferable near the gate . horse tend not to use bad sit shelter shed , no matter how hot or cold it be . when hors be put together in paddock , they need to be careful choose for they mutual compatibility .

in a small group there be little stress to the hors , especially tho lower in the hierarchy , and it be also safer and very pleasant for the people handle and feed they . obviously stallion and colt over ten month old need special arrangement , and brood mare and foal should have a paddock of they own ; but sometimes other horse can be very aggressive . occasionally a gelding , or even a mare , may be so aggressive that there be a real possibility of it serious injur another horse , especially if there be	shelter	shed another horse can be trap in , although for some horse even the corner of the paddock be enough . as we have already mention , for this reason , shelter shed and trough be never place in the very corner of paddock or yard . it be normal not only for stallion to seek mare , but for a mare when she come into season to seek a stallion .

however , the horse in captivity usually cannot help it in anxiety provoke situations : it be dependent upon people for it reduction in anxiety ; it rely upon people for it need . if the need be not satisfy it can have the much injurious result . the need for food , water , and	shelter	be clear , but the horse 's other need be less obvious . horse need to be able to see different thing happen around they , hear different sound , and smell different smell , and so on : they need variety and stimulation . lack of mental or sensory stimulation , in reality enforce boredom , be frequently impose upon thoroughbr race - horse , showhorse , and stallion , with devastat result .
distress by the cold it eventually leave it mother 's side and find the warmth and comfort of the dry stable . incredible , it may not be until several hour late that mum follow she baby inside ! probably this seemingly unintelligent mare be unable to find	shelter	in such weather when they be young , and now as old hors they put up with such condition out of habit a habit that be not conducive to the good health of the horse . horse learn new thing easy when they be young ; it be actual easy for they to learn new thing than it be for old horse . there be two reason for this .
although they will gallop around try to get rid of the bot - fly , they seem to quickly discover that the bot will not follow they into the dense shade of a shelter shed or stable . foal who have learnt to evade bot - fly in such a way , will continue to do so as adult horse if they have access to shelter . old hors who do not try and run away from bot - fly , usually have not have the use of	shelter	shed when they be young , so have form the habit of no long attempt to evade this injurious insect . as we have see , the establishment of a habit can create a situation where a horse refuse to think irrespective of how intelligent a horse may be , and even if solve the problem be in the horse 's own interest . this become even very apparent to we when we try to devise an intelligence test for horse .
the approach to athlone station be very fine , along a wide bridge over the shannon . final i arrive at ballinasloe , to find the station a long way from the town . it be a well - man victorian station , with dark wait room , a parcel office and a quaint neo - gothic	shelter	with an ecclesiastical window at each end . outside , in a field , a lively group of boy and girl be pil branch in a heap for they halloween bonfire . taxi say a voice in i ear .
late that same day , i awoke from a restor sleep to find rain pour down outside , the lake nearly invisible . at the back window , the oak and the steep brown hill look wonderful romantic in the deluge . however , i do not envy the line of white sheep hurry down the mountain to seek	shelter	against mrs knelle 's stone wall . that afternoon we watch television , which be full of the angler strike at lough corrib . the government have denie that there will be fish - farm cage on lough corrib , say the announcer .
soon we be at the village of louth , which gerry pronounce lowth . notic a tiny oratory - style church stand alone in a muddy field , i go over to have a look , leave gerry in the car . sheife run out of i way , take	shelter	behind a piece of wall and peere after i . st mochta 's house , a plaque on the church announce . built in one night to give shelter to the saint , who dy in ad 534 .

we retrace we step to the car , and gerry next drive i to a field near dundalk where he say he could show i an altar use in the penal day . we squelch across the field , final reach the altar , a single slate slab mount on stone , on the side of a bank overlook a tangle of briar . a modern	shelter	have be raise over it , and the ground about the stone have be pave . here the faithful have once meet , safe ( i hope ) from pry protestant eye . that be a pool table , matthew cry .
it be , therefore , the arc of a great circle , the plane of which pass through the centre of the sphere . geodesic shells have a repetivity of edge that be suitable for industrialisation or prefabrication of part to form a lattice that be rigid and lightweight while offer equitable distribution of loading . it can be use at both small and large scale , in the construction of aircraft and in the architecture of they vast	shelter	, hangar , stadium and the like . the principle can be apply to ellipsoid , sausage form , barrel vault and ring such as the torus . buckminster fuller have make a life - time study of geodesic dome .
the embrace can be take to extreme . it can be a clasp that grip and devour and from which there be no escape . or it can be an offer of	shelter	, of friendship , a port in a storm . similarity group tend to be very unify than proximity group , and they can be set in competition . the alternation of stretch and squeezing can be rhythmic .
i do not argue , but many dy from exhaustion every year through not understand the strength of weakness . it be good to stop every day 's travel early so as to have good energy for raise a tent , dig an igloo , build a platform up a tree . dropp down exhaust without	shelter	could bring new meaning to the expression dead tired , . food , doone read out . fish , hunt , trapp .
i squelch across tiny burn run in black channel of peat , and stand look down from the hillside on to the grey roof of scaup farm . the hollow bark of a dog come from one of the stone shed , but there be no sign of life around the building . scaup must be just about the loneli farm in england , tuck down in the	shelter	of the hill with kield forest 's dark mass block it southward view and the narrow valley of the burn fill half the sky to the north . the east kielder burn divide here into scaup burn and white kielder burn . i dropp down the hill to ford white kield upstream of the ruined farmstead of kield head , where a line of stunt alder , shaggy with lichen , lean over they leafless reflection in the peat - brown water .
mohammad issa , another refugee , be quote by dhaka newspaper on wednesday as say that the troop also opened fire on another congregation at sademsa . report of the massacre could not be verify , as burma remain a closed country since the military junta in rangoon intensify it campaign against the arakanese muslims who be know as rohingya , who have fl in they thousand into south - east bangladesh . to date much than 200 , 000 refugee have take	shelter	in bangladesh , putte far strain on it econoi as well as on it relation with burma . the late massacre coincide with the ending of a four - day visit to burma by mr jan k eliasson , secretary general of the unite nation , who be seek a solution to the refugee problem . the spectre of drotch loom over bangladesh 's northern district , with farmer and agriculture official give warn that thousand of acre of rice paddy in about eight north and western district the granary of the country will be ruin .
eat navajo taco and green - pepper steak . liquor cannot be sell on the reservation , but you may take you own . fwe - wheel drive jeep tour take you through the canyon , past hopi village , navajo home with they hogan	shelter	and trade post , and along wind trail . magpy and bluebird dart through the ponderosa pine just before dusk , go to a canyon rim overlook call donkey point and cook a steak on the hot rock .
this be an island situation where the distance from supplier and market add considerab to the overall cost of far . despite be on the same latitude as stockholm and churchill ( canada ) it be a renowned stock - rear area . lack of	shelter	mean that all cattle have to be house for 7 to 8 month . the soil type vary but much of it be peat base . farm be mainly in the 1040 hectare range although there be some large unit .
in england , a scot magistrate at bow street order that bagpipe be a noisy instrument and unsuitable to be play in regent street . back in sunny glasgow , under a placard bear the word dinny doot he , harry hayward dinney , ex - pugilist , wrestler , self - style birdman of argyle street , be arrest for tout he genuine nightingale warbler without a licence . there be talk of build an air - raid	shelter	for 250 , 000 people under hampden park , and while plan be be make to dig down beneath the city , in another park , bellahouston , work be far advance on the tremendous empire exhibition and a tower that would rise 300 foot above bellahouston hill , 470 foot above sea - level . tait 's tower be to be the symbol of the progress that peace and tomorrow must sure bring . andy pull back the spring - loade handle of the machine and release it with a thump .
similarly , residential care have be prefer at some time much than other , so until the eighteen century in the netherlands and flander the foster family be see as the good place for orphan , foundling , and abandon child and have long be extensive use to care for needy child in scotland ( packman , 1975 ; pinchbeck and hewitt , 1973 ; pyck et al . , 1985 ) . in the unite kingdom , of course , there be also a well - establish system of private boarding school which	shelter	twice as many child as welfare establishment and absorb much middle - class need ( lambert et al . , 1975 ) . child care in the unite kingdom be , as indicate , very closely associate with the poor law , the system of care and financial relief for poor family .
he also comment on pinus rigida , pitch or virginian pine , reach great height in it native country , and there be many at woburn , twenty foot high , though not of many year stand and keep pace with the other kind of pine and fir in the same plantation . when kalm visit miller , they discuss cultivation of tree , particularly conifer , and he be tell that at woburn larch have be plant some in good soil , some in meagre and the latter look very lively , while the former look quite droop , as though they be oblige reluctantly to force they to grow . there be correspondence with woburn over the construction of a	shelter	for orange tree , to be add to an exist wall , with a moveable roof erecte every autumn . the glass for this could , miller suggest , be of inferior quality for the top , but the front should be glaz will with new castle glass . miller be conscious of economy and recognise that from an aesthetic viewpoint the duke must be gratify , but feel that good use could be make of cheaper material elsewhere .
have guarantee he homeland 's future , old joseph , tuekaka , be bury in the wallowa . he favourite horse be shoot and drape over the grave and a dreamer bell be suspend over the chief 's body , to r in the wind until a white man stole it in 1874 . joseph ride away at the head of he people , seek	shelter	from the winter snow , recall of he father : i bury he in that beautiful valley of winding water . i love that land much than all the rest of the world .
some warrior desperately engage the lead soldier . other flee among the riverside willow , and then circle around the soldier 's rear . the woman and child rush for the	shelter	of the riverbank . rainbow , who wyakin serve he only after sunrise , fall in the first attack when he rifle jam . five wound , in he grief , be kill make a lone charge .
the boston truce five inch of snow fall through the night . a woman of the band late recall how the besieged nez perce dug	shelter	- pit for the helpless one and rifle - pit for the warrior : we dig the trench with cama hooks and butch knife . with pans we throw out the dirt
send the messenger back where they belong , joseph consult look glass and white bird . they both refuse to surrender to a man of two face , but joseph say , many of we people be out on the hill , nake and freeze . the woman be suffer with cold , the child cry with the chille dampness of the	shelter	pit . for i i do not care . it be for they i be go to surrender .
a royal wedding take place on 26th . april 1923 , which have great significance than be realise then the duke of york marry lady elizabeth bowe - lyon , who late become k george vi and queen elizabeth now the queen mother . also in 1923 , the urban district council of chiswick purchase from the duke of devonshire , one hundred and thirty acre of riverside meadowland , for public use and it be adapt with embankment , tree lined promenade ,	shelter	and a bandstand . this dukes meadow be particularly recall on the occasion of the annual university boat race . because reparation have not be receive from germany , french and belgian troop re - occupy the ruhr area of germany in january 1923 .
no such assurance be receive , but the german troop advance very rapid , caw some concern to russia , so stalin decide that he would prefer the german troop to stop halfway across poland and he send he troop into that poor country from the east . in addition ; stalin realise that russia be vulnerable from attack through finland , so between the end of november 1939 and the spring of 1940 , russian troop fight the finish and achieve control of the baltic state . back in britain , man be call to arm ; everyone be issue with a ga mask ; sandbag be provide to protect specify building and to provide some	shelter	against the expect air attack , and provision of air raid shelters be hasten . concern for the safety of young child result in a massive scheme to evacuate child from the vulnerable city to safe home in much isolated country area . that endeavour be prove to be somewhat premature as no real bomb of city occur until the follow year , and many of the child have return home only to have to be again evacuate when the bomb did start .
as a result , some long - lose annual plant once characteristic of the area be start to return . in denmark , the authority encourage and finance the re - establishment of fringe plant community and marsh alongside river which be once canalise . the plant provide	shelter	for animal , trap sild and draw nutrient from the water . bacteria in mud and in the root mass naturally denitrify the water . the ncc propose that farmer should now leave uncultivate strip of land alongside watercourse as soak , act as wildlife habitat and fit in well with maff plan for set - aside of land to help curb over - production of food .
the pupil join up in small group to make a tentative exploration of they environment . each one may be make responsible for a specific task . for example , seek out water and food , look for suitable place to make a	shelter	, gather wood , or identify source of danger ( p . 93 ) . typically of experience teacher recognise the potential weakness of the whole venture ( it will in fact only succeed if the pupil be determine to make it succeed not something one can often rely on ! ) , precaution be adopt such as war they beforehand to mark out the route they take , and ( the final card up teacher 's sleeve as pupil start to get kill all over the place ) to come in as narrator say , sudden , for no apparent reason , the danger pass and the member return to safety ! the basic problem be that the givens be not clear enough .
but the location 's convenience for that oxbridge dons who form the nucleus of the original community have weigh down the scale against possible danger of discovery ; and this judgment be vindicate , because we be never bomb . this be as well , for even a single light raid would have reduce the flimsy hut to matchwand . for we part , we appear to take for grant the german 's total ignorance of we presence , for we have no air - raid drill , nor do we have a single air - raid	shelter	, slight - trench , sandbag blast - wall , nor even so much as a steel helmet only a large poster which read : keep cool and carry on on the day after i arrival at bletchley , i hear a scottish voice and , be a little homesick , i sotch out the owner .
lastly , windblown sand have accumulate up to a height of 150 metre , where rock - core hill with gentle slope lie close to beach or erod dune area which furnish a steady supply of sand . many area of this terrain with gneiss rock outcrops amongst the windblown sand occur from about 10 or 15 metre elevation . the gneiss have little influence on the soil apart from create local	shelter	, where the windblown sand can accumulate . this land type occur on pabbay , boreray and berneray ( sound of harris ) and on the island from eriskay to mingulay , and the soil mainly comprise calcareous regosol . till - cover plain
various society , at various time in history , have formally and officially treat the world with reverence . often this people believe that each of the component of nature the forest , the river , the sky be occupy and guard by a jealous god , and they behave as if that be the case . other society , at other time , have simply regarde the element of nature as commodity : source of food , fuel ,	shelter	, transport , and wealth . they have act on the principle of out of sight , out of mind . this latter attitude be not unique to modern time , or to western people .
but they be extremely important component of the tropical scene ; rich in specy and serve as nest site and nursery for bird and fish . other anemone , winkle , starfish be affix in or move into shelter place , under rock , and remain cool and reasonably moist and protect from pounding . seaweeds such as the brown kelp produce mucus - like material to hold moisture , and in any case can survive desiccation ; and many animal , include shore crab ,	shelter	among they damp frond . so the shore - line creature adopt several different strategy for survival ; and animal from very different phyla notable coelenterate , mollusc , crustacean , and echinoderm have find ( various ) way of cop with the intertidal zone . and although the number of specy in the intertidal zone be not necessarily enormous , individual of that specialist that have evolve to cope be often present in very large number .
mangrove be tree that grow right at the edge of the sea , hold and nourish through characteristic prop root that grip the soft mud . they be not a specific kind of tree , but a way of be a tree ; several unrelated specy ( black mangrove , white mangrove , etc ) be involve . in florida , the caribbean , queensland , and south east asia they may be extremely extensive , and be important not only for the huge variety of life within they crab , spider , mollusc but also for the many creature that visit they for food ( heron , egret ) and which bree in the	shelter	they provide . in particular , mangrove be the nursery for huge number of tropical fish , which as adult live in the open sea . if mangrove be destroy ( as they often be , to create beach and hotel as in miami ) then marine ecosystem a thousand mile away may suffer .
six trent have be correct in guess they destination to be on the north fork of the belpan river . once into the	shelter	of the mangrove - bind estuary , he have take the man off the zodiac , order they below after stack the dinghy 's cargo along golden girl 's side deck . with the wind dead on they stern , he have change the genoa for a much bigger and lighter cut . main boom out to port , genoa to starboard , they ghost up the smooth water of the river like a giant white butterfly as the first grey touch of dawn lighten the sky .
he man would be watch the road rather than the river , pluck politician into they net as miguelito have boast easy as pluck ripe advocado . trent push off from the bank , swimm with he bound hand in an adaptation of sidestroke that be clumsy and inefficient . once out of the	shelter	of the bank he find the wind have strengthen . that , too , would make he escape very difficult . on the other hand , once clear of the river mouth , he could sail a clear reach for key canaka .
already they be close to the middle of the cloud funnel . ten minute , fiftee at the much , and the wind would be on they , tear they from the saddle . ten , fifteen minute to gain the	shelter	of the forest though even there they would be in danger of be pul into nothingness by tree rip from the rain - soften earth . nine the front of the hurricane tear at the low flank of the mountain , rend great tree from the rain for and tosse they aside as if they be little much than stick .
mariana point trent to the left . another five minute and they be at the edge of the meadow . trent brak and swing the bmw back into the	shelter	of the pine tree . kick down the foot - rest , he dismount and stretch a little of the stiffness out of he shoulder . he unsling the gun case from across he chest , unzipp it as he give mariana a grin .
the villa location , large hide in undergrowth , be mark with a stone tablet erecte by the club . throughout the 1950 's , the battle for member and great income , be fight relentless and an appeal go out in 1954 for donation and gift . in come a typewrite , crested glass , course	shelter	and so on , such gift be regularly make throughout the decade . in 1953 mrs j.p . ( phoebe ) bradley become the first lady to serve on the club committee , an event doubly unique , for although not a bondholder she be elect by they committee to represent they for a four - year term .
the scope of they kinship network be small , but just as significan because they provide help in time of hardship . it be usually to relative that the peasant migrat to the city turn for help in the new and frighten environment . it be kin , often , who provide	shelter	during the first day in the town and who help the migrant build his/her own home . it be they , too , who lend him/her money for the journey and help him/her look for a job in the urban environment . the migration process frequently involve a chain of relative from rural village to urban neighbourhood .
the rapid increase urban population have place an impossible strain on the provision of housing . the house deficit in mexico be about 4 million unit , which mean that about 30 per cent of the population be in need of housing ( hurtado 1986 ) . since the standard house of town and city have be unable to provide	shelter	, urban population have be compell to take the situation into they own hand and put up they own home . this squatter settlement have spring up in great abundance , general in undesirable and inaccessible area , which be unsuitable for standard building . the settlement be often find on steep slope , such as that in rio de janeiro , which ever the hill behind the luxury tourist attraction of ipanima and copacabana beach .
the peruvian military react with force during the pamplona invasion in may 1971 , when they try to evict the ten of thousand who have participate in this huge squatter invasion in lima , with the result that there be several injury and one death ( colly 1975 ) . other government have viewe the spontaneous house settlement as wretch area , which not only house society 's drop - outs , but be also breed ground for crime and radical political activity the brazilian government have try to eradicate the squatter settlement for this reason , which be especially the case in rio de janeiro , because of the added factor that it be an international tourist centre and the favela be so visible on the steep hillside behind the luxury hotel and beach . some of the favela have be knock down , but there still remain the problem of	shelter	for they inhabitant . as a result , when shack disappear , other appear in other part of the city . the government have attempt some favela removal program , but this have not be very successful , mainly because the new housing scheme be too expensive .
gerry 's study in dakar , senegal , reveals similar link between apparently independent petty producer and large enterprise , as exist between the garbage picker and the paper industry ( gerry 1979 ) . conclusion motivate by a desire for a good life , rural population have migrate to urban area and the result expansion of city have mean problem of	shelter	and employmend . for many , the movement be one of horizontal mobility rather than vertical . some of the discussion of the informal sector and the turner these suggest that , for a minority , there may be small improvement in housing or occupation , but the majority remain part of the mass of the urban poor .
leapor 's essay on friendship end with a surprisingly mode claim : we chief task be seldo to offend , / and life 's great blesse a well - choose friend ml , 1 , 80 . it seem that one of the great pain of leapor 's life be the lack of such friendship . she relationship with freemantle seem to have provide she with	shelter	from an often upset social life in brackley . the visit present an unusual picture of mira who be simply defeate by the scold dame and the gossip and physiognomist of brackley : o artemisia ! dear to i ,
he make it clear that it be for sir rufus to determine , and for you to comply . however , i expect that he will do as you wish . at the cab rank they go to the	shelter	, where driver could while away the night hour in warmth and obtain food . bragg go over to the counter , where a man be pour cup of strong tea . police , he say .
we will never get rid of this case . let 's see if the cabby have something for we . they cross to the	shelter	and go inside . have you discover anything for i he ask the man behind the counter . you be the copper what call yesterday , be not you
bragg take the envelope and read the scrawl on the back . he say that he have some grub here , around half - past four on wednesday morning . as he go out of the	shelter	, he see two people with a barrow , a man and a woman , he say . they be push it litte , towards the city . by the time he get to he cab , they have go as far as holborn circus .
and she have be pretty on that slab , all the influence of birth and upbring cancell out . he would have be delight with a daughter who look like that . whatever she situation , she have still be a human be , entitle to warmth and	shelter	and protection . she have not become a whore because she want to ; it be because the money of pervert old man have offer she an easy way out of poverty that same old man who would clamour for the investigation to be dropped.well , he be not go to play games.in strictness , the coroner be independent of the police.a he officer it be bragg 's duty to investigate , regardless of any other case . so long as he have the support of sir rufus stone , he could thumb he nose at cotton .
he soon become a familiar hazard with he dog kim , the village terror , and he car in which he would career at fully twenty mile an hour down the narrow lane . the villager all think he be a rum one a very rum one , remember one of he neighbour . it be not until the famous hertfordshire blizzard of 1915 , when shaw go out and work with the menfolk saw up tree that lie block the road , and the zeppelin raid the follow year ( which he incorporate into he play heartbreak house ) , when he offer he cellar as a	shelter	, that the villager grow friend with he . only one of he play , the charming comedietta for two voice in three conversations call village wooing , which feature the local postmistress , take it inspiration from ayot . but many of he comedy , romance and extravaganza after the doctor 's dilemma be part write there .
in may of 1948 , the zamzam cross the palestine border into lebanon at naqqoura where the palestinian write kalafani be to describe the misery of the refugee and rent a house in tyre for 12 palestinian pound a month . we move to baa camp from there , she say . we have only tent for	shelter	and we try to make concrete block . then we come to rashidiyeh . i think i would go home when i leave but it have be a long time .
lebanon have already suffere for the palestinian 's presence . from 1968 , the plo sent raid party into israel from southern lebanon and the israeli respond by launch they own revenge raid , often against lebanis village . the motive be simple and comparatively cost - free : if the lebanese villager allow armed palestinian to take	shelter	among they home , then they would be make to pay for it in blood . the only way to avoid israeli attack be to eject the palestinian from they village . this , of course , the lebanese could not do .
wate be a relatively good shield against cosmic ray . for solar flare , a system of early warning satellite around the sun could detect the first sign of trouble . sensor on the craft bind for mar would detect light from a flare and the crew could take	shelter	in a shielded room before the slow proton arrive . the report from the national academy of science will highlight microgravity , radiation and psychological fitness as the three main thrust of an invigorate biology programme . whether it come about depend as much on politician as on scientist .
in fine weather spin be do out of door . spinster and knitter in the sun , as shakespeare wrote . wordsworth also give a description of a family spin in the sunshine in the brother , but the lake district have a high than average rainfall and in wet and windy weather spinner no doubt sotch	shelter	where it be available . there be considerable confusion about the use of the distaff , sometimes refer to as a rock , probably because of the old term distaff and spear side of the family . swrite often mistaken use such term as woman spin with they distaff .
i have plan to take a train there ; to head south and see much of south america . yet i mill around the edge of the crowd at the demonstration feel completely detach . it begin to pou and i take	shelter	in a basement caf . i wrote a few postcard i have much faith in bolivia 's postal service than peru 's and wonder what i be do here . i have work hard while i be on amantani , reconstruct the bone of i experience without the satisfaction of cradl they in apposite language .
he much than fill the gap leave by alex ; he presence animate she with a mysterious excitement . the sweet precocity of this infant romance delight every adult who observe it , which in turn encoura richard in he chivalry and victoria in coy connivance . i should like to marry tory when i grow up , he tell marie decisive during a rainy afternoon which drive the child in to the chilly	shelter	of the aberknowe kitchen . will you mind very much you can come and live with we afterwards if you like .
that drat child never seem to hurry , but slip along like a cloud shadow , faster than you will expect . at last there be the hut , crouch near it grove of hive . and squatt in what little	shelter	there be beside the door , just where she will expect he , farquhar nea . it be no part of she plan to rush in on they . she pick she way gently down to the door , nod pleasantly to farquhar and bend under the lintel , to find she husband sit by the tiny fireplace , watch marion turn a hare on a spit over it .
there be new source of inspiration . where the palace , the temple , and the cathedral have inspire they victorian predecessor , british station - builder of the inter - war year choose much democratic model the cinema ( surbiton ) , the bank ( exmouth ) , and , with unintended irony , the garage ( west monkseaton ) . they in they turn be to give way after tunenlightenedhe second world war to the model of the bus -	shelter	, the airport , and the office - block , the ultimate in bankruptcy of imagination . the railway industry have a propaganda purpose in the streamlining of outline and in the new doctrine of modernism in this year . streamlin implied speed and , in increasingly acute competition with road transport , the railway 's commitment to superior speed need to be stress constant .
but they spirit have entirele vanish by the second world war . new large city station be buil at toledo ( 1950 ) and new orlean ( 1954 ) , but in a totally undistinguish style . otherwise bus	shelter	be provide when small stations be knock or burn down . just such a brave new station be the romantically name route 128 at boston . by the time that the educational facility laboratory and the national endowment for the art be produce they two excellent booklet on the reuse of railroad stations in 1974 and 1975 , only one per cent of all inter - city travel be by train .
it retain many of the traditional feature of stations , include a clock - tow much than 100 ft . high , and large circulation area adorn with tile with maori motif , and fresco depict new zealand scene . this inaugurate a new wave of station - building . at a time when new stations elsewhere mean bus	shelter	, fine new stations which retain at little some of the spirit of the old be provide at taita , palmerston north , and rotorua , among other . nevertheless , small rural stations have be close throughout new zealand , often to the accompaniment of vigorous opposition from new zealand farmer . despite they rearguard action , however , freight handling have be concentrate at large stations , destroy the role of the small station in the community .
dog in general , rottweiler in particular , be loyal and reliable ; dare i say , much very reliable than human being ! we have take from the rottweiler , companionship and help in many field : hunt , protec we home and family , pull cart , act as guide dog for the blind , search and rescue , herd cattle and so on . in return , we give we companion	shelter	and food . it be an unwrite agreement and if we renege on it , let we not be surprise if we dog lose he respect for we , for we be not worthy of be call master . in modern time , the demand we make have change in some way .
hotel and house nestle among the vegetation . although this area be buil up , nature burst out all around . coconut palm bow towards the sea , banana tree afford	shelter	at bus stop and vividly colour croton hedg eseparat the patch of one clapboard chattel house from the next . there be no visible grind poverty and no antagonism towards tourist . other runner wave , but there be no much reaction from pedestrian to the eccentric prospect we must present than there be in britain .
look careful at the pavement as there be many detail that tell a story . coal hole cover be make in different pattern and emboss with the name of the foundry ; outside old house , the bootscraper can often still be see . many category of street furniture can now be list pillar box , telephone kiosk , drink fountain and bus	shelter	. though the traditional pillar box oval , round or octagonal appear at the moment safe , the wall - mount variety be under threat . due to public outcry , well over 1 , 000 ( out of perhaps 50, 000 ) red telephone box have be list , but this of course be only a tiny fraction .
a red telephone box on a village green be part of the country scene , as quintessential in it way as the village pond or pub . a red telephone box in such circumstance may not be special in it , but special to the area . great care be take in the early year of this century to design bus	shelter	that be in keep with country village . they be not only wor preserve in they ; a watchful eye need to be keep to ensure that some other piece of street furniture say one of the new all - glass telephone box be not crudely juxtapose beside they . an active local society need to be in constant contact with not only the local authority but all the public utility .
donkey salute we pass with that howl of anguish that have make maiden lady establish animal sanctuary in cairo between the war . tiny child , barefoot and dirty , try to generate enough courage to touch we for a few fils . the cave give	shelter	to a new generation of troglodyte european nomad , australian girl end they grand tour by go native , that few english woman who have feel the lure of the desert so intently that they now nurse fair - haired , olive - skin baby and hang they washing - line from one eroded pinnacle to another . another day i go into the siq when the sun be set and the air be already chill . smoke from charcoal fire swirl from this windowless dwelling .
the raid on the british citie be another matter . i cycle to school one morning through street littere with glass , and past a little nonconformist chapel , in which everything have be destroy except the far wall with it multi - colour and scroll message god be love . i stand one night outside the air - raid	shelter	which we share with neighbour , look towards a great glow in the sky . bristol be burn , and this be not the light of oxford with a message of unattainable ambition . cardiff high school lose many of it window , but latin grammar go on .
this change of emphasis from cash to produce be probably the much difficult mental hurdle . immediate cash profit have far too long be the overrid aim : it have warp the genuine economy and force farmer to consider every move in the context of how soon will it pay cash profit be necessary ; but the near a community can come to provide it own basic requirement of food ,	shelter	, and energy , the little cash be need for the luxury . within the pattern of large - scale commercial far , the independent smallholder can still provide very than he share of surplus food for the urban population , yet keep as top priority the conservation of he main capital the soil . the acceptance of discipline be probably the great step towards freedom a man can take , and nowhere be this so true as in smallhold .
you should therefore devise a clear plan with prioritie , and introduce you livestock bit by bit as you fence permit . by far the strongest and much permanent field division be stone wall . once buil they will last forever , the material for repair be always on site , and they provide	shelter	from wind and weather . few can afford the time and cost of building a new stone wall today , but the principle of dry stone wall , clearly outlin in rainsford - hannay 's book dry stone wall , be straightforward and you can easy acquire enough skill to do effective repair . well - lay hedge of thorn , hazel , holly , or beech ( or very generally a mixture of several specy ) form very effective barrier , and provide shelter for livestock and a habitat for wild life .

if this could be prove beyond doubt , direct drilling would fit in well with the organic philosophy . the drill be too expensive for a smallholding , and even in the hand of a contractor , the technique ( include spraie ) be not cheaper than conventional tillage . perennial weed such as couch or coltsfoot be very difficult to control , and slug , which	shelter	and multiply in the deep , hard - sided slit , can become a serious pest . winter cereal be slow to establish , and must be sown earlier : this be apparently because there be a tendency for stubble or kill turf to be push down into the slit with the seed where it can create anaerobic condition lead to the formation of toxic substance such as acetic acid . but one might be forgive for doubt if this be the much likely cause of the toxic side - effect of direct drill !
one line , bury near the article 's conclusion , cause a great deal of stress within the smiths 's rank . recent report of the smiths damage the prospective career of small outfit with action aim in pure spite at rough trade , hardly inspire confidence . a strange and , to that unaware of the easterhouse situation , ambiguous line which see morrissey run for the	shelter	of he lawyer , alexis grow . so , one fine morning the magazine 's publisher and feature write receive a notice inform they that steven morrissey and johnny marr be proceed with an action for defamation of character . it seem bizarre that a band plague by such huge problem on an international scale should wish to waste they time attempt to sue a small time and , to be frank , penniless magazine .
it lead only to the charles inglis clark mountain hut , a prestigious private hut own by the scottish mountaineering club and hence frequent by respectable rock - clim doctor , lawyer and accountant . the hut be in a much peculiar situation , perch perfect as the map would imply , to receive the maximum effect of the avalanche load slope behind it . not only that , but one imagine such hut to be find in the very heart of the wilderness , where one cannot ascend a peak and walk out in a single day , and must take	shelter	for the night . hardly the case here . a resident at the c.i.c . hut could easy do a spot of rock - clim , nip into fort william to indulge in some leisure shop for tartan gonk and still be back in time for a se - song round the primus stove .
try cop with a party of underprivileged schoolchild from a house estate in manchester with a near - hysterical social worker , a ghetto blaster and some crisp bag to sniff glue , two glum shaven - heade squaddy with flatulence , and a computer programmer from maidstone who want to tell you about why he promotion fall through , and then with one eye twitch , accuse you of have stol he process cheese . use properly , bothie be place of great convenience and delight , but do remember a couple of important point . do not assume you will find	shelter	in a bothy and walk into the wilderness without an alternative . sometimes bothie be lock , particularly during the stalk season , and very often you open the door to find there be 75 people cramm into a shack built to accommodate 15 . if you do manage to find a place in one , you must tidy it up when you be ready to leave and remember to take you litter with you .
one wild evening , when the wind be howl and rain lash down , i take peter brewer , a somerset bank manage up to the loch , much against he good judgment . look , could not we just go along to the pub and have a quiet drink and talk about fish instead he pleade . we assemble we rod in the	shelter	of the old boathouse on the south shore and i stride purposefully to the loch , almost as a matter of principal . i estimate that perhaps fifteen minute 's fish would salve i honour , and not expecte to catch anything , i let the wind flag i fly out over the water . the tail fly , a size 14 silver butcher graze the surface and immediately the water erupt .
the subject still occupy charles 's mind late that night . beside he , dimity sleep peacefully , but the rector could not re . there be no doubt about it , he be fail as a husband if he could not provide such basic thing as warmth and	shelter	for he wife . the poor rector toss unhappily . something must be do .
young people queue for laker airline ticket in london , 1978 . to get a ticket on laker 's skytrain in the summer of 1978 ( 59 one way , available only on day of flight ) you have to join a queue 2, 000 people long . sometimes the wait to reach the ticket office in london 's victoria station take five day so the queuer build they	shelter	of cardboard , plastic sack and stre , turn the queue into a shanty town wittily christen lakerville by it occupant . but the reward be the cheap transatlantic air ticket available . sir freddie laker be the entrepreneurial fox who cheeky jump into the airline 's broiler house and mightily ruffle they wing .
after cross blindbeck bridge , which span a tributary of barbon beck , the main stream drain the valley , a large open space alongside the road invite a halt . look up the hillside to the north from this point , the splendid cairn of josse pike can be see prominently . the cairn be erecte in the 1870 by the local gamekeeper and name after he : it stand twelve foot high with an interior provide	shelter	, and occupy a vantage point from which josse could survey the whole of he domain . from the open space , the road continue straight as an arrow with barbon beck now alongside , the narrow strip of tarmac cross a watershed and descend to gawthrop after four lonely mile without habitation ; dent town be then reach one mile far on . there be little surface evidence of limestone in barbondale .
if the car be there and unattend , the driver will probably be inside . the area around chapel - le - dale be scenically attractive and prolific in surprise : it be a wonderland deserve a separate expedition and a leisurely exploration . a line of farmhouse	shelter	below the steep eastern slope of whernside , distan from the main road and rare disturb by tourist and sightseer . link by lane and quiet road , there be a pleasant circular walk free of traffic ( car be not welcome ) and without danger from bull , dog and irate farmer . start and finish at the hill inn , the walk pass through a district liberal pockmark with cave and pothole of which bruntscar and gatekirk cave be especially worth a halt to inspect the outside .
yet despite all this , el cid be probably spain 's great hero . he be fame for he just behaviour , nobility and magnanimity . he be so respecte by he natural enemy , the moors , that when he be exil by he christian overlord , they be much than willing to give he	shelter	and employment . indeed , it be the moor who give he the title by which he be good know , a contraction of the arabic sid - y , mea i lord . he be bear in 1043 at bivar , a village to the north of burgo in northern spain .
he look with half - closed eye eastward into the wind . the wind will be even bad , he say . stay and	shelter	here . i have tea and bread . when will the wind stop
the sky in the east be brown with dust , and the sun veile . within minute the brown patch of sky envelop i , as a violent storm sweep across the dune . rather than turn back and	shelter	with idris , i keep move . half a day save now would mean reach joan and kano that much earlier . although i be tempt to think that such a short time would make no difference , i know that when i get near to kano , if i get that far , every minute would count .
then he see they . they come into full view ; he daughter in the arm of what appear a working man . it be an actual roar he let out and it be mingle with jessie 's scream as he tear she from the	shelter	of the coalhouse and the young man 's arm . he voice fill the yard as he yell , you dirty little hussy , you ! and when he thrust at she , still yelle , get up into that house , there ! and almost push she onto she back , the young fellow sprang forward and grab she ; then , with one arm around she and the other fist doubl , forefinger point out straight at the man , he cry at he , you lie another hand on she like that , mister , an ' that will be the last thing you do .
and she could not sleep on the floor of the factory with the mice skitter round , and the black beetle everywhere . a great desire to stand and cry descend on she . the next minute she be run out of the yard and into the street again and into the	shelter	of the doorway lead into the hat shop . there be a bell here , too , that communicate with the misses cardings 's room above . she be press it for dear life now as if she be in a panic , and she keep she finger on it until , through the glass door , she see the flicker of a candle weave it way down through the shop .
he be very proud of the new tree , you would think they be he . only god can make a tree , he say , but we can give he a hand now and then . besides you need the wind	shelter	, the pest need the bird and the soil need the pest . we all need each other . everything depend on something .

it be also in the close week of the year that long exploration of the somerset landscape by coleridge and the wordsworth begin to have far reach creative consequence . during one excursion which probably occur at this time tom poole take he friend to walford 's gibbet on the quantock slope between holford and stowey , and there recount john walford 's tragic history . walford , a charcoal - burner who have spend he solitary life in a woodland	shelter	buil of pole and turf , be remember by tom poole as a man remarkable for good temper and generosity , but one who also possess ardent feeling and strong passion . he be deeply in love with an over stowey woman call ann rice , but be force into marriage to a half - mad girl who have visit he at he shelter and who bore he two illegitimate child . they marry in june 1789 , and a month late , in despair and rage , he murder she as they walk in the darkness to the castle of comfort inn .
we connection for the prison camp do not leave until 11 o'clock and the feldwebel be wonder what to do for the next two hour when the air raid siren blew . it sound the same as the english si except that it be slow . we go down into the station	shelter	and i experience the familiar claustrophobic sensation of wait for something to happen . the shelter be clean and well build . civilian sit on bench jok and play card and rock scream babie to sleep .
but this be not so ; no one land there have ever be able to get out and the near airport be 600 mile away . the pilot and crew have , in some instance , be able to trek overland to safety but the aircraft , value at many millions , would remain there imprison forever . late that afternoon we make a perfect three - point land at the rcaf airstrip in whitehorse , capital of the yukon territory , where i find	shelter	for the night in a bare but adequate room at the whitehorse hotel . not far away a turgid and fast move river rush southward in narrow gorge . beached there be old weather - wear skeleton of the side - wheel paddle boat former use for passenge service between whitehorse and dawson city .
even before i get to understand guilt , i use to walk about the house muttere , you be a subject for guilt , boy , a subject for guilt . that be , of course , when i be not actual cast an eye at the rope and pulley high over the hall or take a glance at the shotgun . i wrap guild around i like a thick overcoat , wallow in it and even take	shelter	in it . in almost anything that happen i could find guild and apply it to i . a tick off at school , or a beat left i encrust with guilt .
apart from the increase pressure on fuelwood , rubbish disposal be disfigur the landscape , especially along the trail from lukla , through namche bazar , to the evere base camp . clim expedition into the peaks they have also leave behind pile of rubbish , and cullen ( 1986 ) point out that the problem be compound by the fact that in such a high alpine environment decomposition rate be very slow so that discard material may persist for several year if not decade . moreover , expedition tend to congregate in a few favour area which provide rapid access to peak as well as adequate water supply and	shelter	from natural hazard like avalanch . add to this the rapid growth in the number of expedition , climber and trekker which have occur in recent year and it be not surprise that the problem have reach massive proportion despite the availability of new access site from tibet which be opened to climber in 1980 . obviously , the harsh terrain and the inhospitable weather condition mean that rubbish disposal be a subordinate concern , in relation to clim goal and survival , of climber in the mountain peaks , the major problem area be the base camp .
southworth et al . ( 1989 ) have enhance the massvac model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call mvopl . this module have be develop use ibm 's graphics kernel system and provide a number of display screen . the much interesting be that which portray population flows as scale ribbon on the network diagram , and evacuation	shelter	capacity as bar diagram . the diagram be update periodically during the course of the simulation . in dry part of the world , such as australia , for and bush fire be an important natural hazard and some attention have be give to the way in which gis might help exai they potential impact .
as we neare arran the cloud become denser , and in turn cast deep shadow over the firth and the arran coast , or be light up with a glow of intensely bright sunlight ; while the glory of arran , it mountain - peaks , be lose amy the cloud that enshroude they . on land i sotch for the cottage occupy by the duke of hamilton 's piper , in which some friend have find much comfortable quarter the season before . i find it preoccupy by a little company of artist , either professional or amateur , who make use of the rainy day by camp in the coach - house to sketch from it	shelter	a fine group of tree , with some good foreground rock and bracken , all within a stone - throw of the cottage . the piper 's little girl be mount on horseback , and dispatch to brodick in quest of a lodge , and return with the news that there be a spare room at the boat - house . the boat - house become i roost - place while under the shadow of the mighty mountain of the wind , goat fell .
none the little , springhall be unwill to conclude that young people be repress by adult . he ask rhetorically if there have be a deliberate conspiracy to keep adolescent in an inferior social and economic position . in answer he correct remind we that young people be often of necessity in a subservient position as a result of they dependence on parent for food , clothing , and	shelter	; teacher for school ; employer for employment ; skilled worker for instruction in apprenticed trade ; and on youth worker for leisure activity . on this basis he maintain that this adult should not be see as agents of social control represse the young as reductionist social history might sugge but as agents of socialization prepare they for they future role as citizen in a society to which many adolescent give unthink and willing allegiance . no one dispute that agent of socialization be hard at work on work - class adolescent .
the sound make he go a little faster , but progress be slow and difficult and he be near the point of exhaustion . he would have to rest . a snow - cover hedge loom up ahead of he and he make for the	shelter	of it . as he reach it , the ground fall away from under he and he roll down into a deep ditch . there be water at the bottom cover by a thin skin of ice and he splash into it face first .
then we could destroy line of communication : wreck telegraph wire , blow up bridge and railway line . they would have to send troop down from castlebar to seek out and destroy we . then we would have to go on the run , move from place to place , rely on the people to feed and	shelter	we . it would mean havin ' to place we life in they hand . a guerrilla unit can only operate in a district where the people be staunch and know how to keep they mouth shut .
before the war begin , listen to reminiscence of that who have experience the last war and sense they dread , i imagin that once a war have start , no one would ever be happy again . the reality surprise i at first , and then like everyone else , i take it for grant . the rationing of food and of clothes , the air raid warning which send we into	shelter	, the train which run late and be always overcrowd , this thing become an accept part of life . far from the atmosphere of doom and gloom which i have imagine , there be far much camaraderie and cheerfulness than be shown nowaday . it be a sad reflection on life that it take dang and suffer to bring people closer together .
it be time for he to leave as well . the house have fall ; in the ground be ten russian for every frenchman . another undignify scramble , over the wall into the pheasantry and the	shelter	of the tree . here the last of the french have regroup to make a final stand before the inevitable retreat . from tree and undergrowth they fire at the victor again and again , as they swarm over the wall in two and three , then in dozen and score , and final in hundred .
the loss of he favourite local be quite enough punishment to this patriot so find in the coal yard go on to the document . the christian church be quite unite in fulham . the father of the church of the servite serve in the	shelter	with the rector of all saint , the baptist pastor and we rev kenneth oliver . rev kenneth be determin , now that we be not able to leave the hospital ground after darkness fell , to see that we mind be not imprison . he have a list of all the local act talent .
the bad problem be to try to explain quarantine regulations to the black - clothed mother who would not go away from the main gate and wail bitterly oh ! mio bambino ! mio bambino ! till mr rideout have to have dr hill 's attendance lest he too become a patient . we enga out - station nurse to be in attendance at the hotel by day and night , by day to supervise feed and help the mother get food from any shop they could . by night to comfort they in the	shelter	during raid . then fulham get one of she bad raid of the war . i suspect the enemy be really after the railway this time .
come along grandma i say . we must take cover . i lead she to a small	shelter	in the palace side of the park . good gracious , that be close i say , as i hear a god - almighty thud . many fire engine rush about .
condition on many death row be appall . in alabama 's west jefferson prison inmate be keep in tiny cell , with the bare minimum of furniture . there be no outside view of any	sort	and the only time they leave the cell be for weekend visit from relative , bi - daily shower or for 45 minute 's daily exercise . it be not surprise that many inmate want to give up they appeal . the hardest two hour of i life be spend try to persuade david nelson to take up he appeal .
we american friend 's cousin in london be an art student . she college library have interesting book , as well as the late art magazine . she course teach have give she a read list , and the library staff be good at help student with all	sort	of interest . as part of the course , she have to choose a subject of she own about which to write a paper ; one of she difficulty be to know how to form she own view , not just copy already receive opinion . she be look for critical view against which to pitch she own ; it seem that she may have choose the wrong sort of topic , since on a holiday in italy she have be stun by the newly renovate michelangelo ceil in the sistine chapel in rome , and although there be plenty of book about it , many of they go into extravagant detail .
thing be not so simple , as some art historian write well about the present , with a generosity of feeling and approach enrich to contemporary culture . they be capable of assesse modern art in it own term , partly from experience gain through judge work of other period within quite different term . meyer schapiro , who have a specialist concern with romanesque art , be an open - minded historian of this	sort	. he wrote enthusiastically about the late work of arshile gorky : gorky 's atmosphere , veile the hard opaque wall of the canvas , evoke a nocturnal void or the vague , unstable image - space of the day - dreame mind . and he remember the painter :
indeed , there be some who feel that there should be no border , think back nostalgically to day when there be only one domain of art . in some write today , too , it be possible to find the word critic and historian be use interchangeable . art be after all the subject of attention for both critic and historian , even though the function and method of the two	sort	of write have draw apart . fifty year ago they be in closer touch . it be in 1936 that the first american edition of lionello venturi 's history of art criticism be publish , contain material which could equally have find a place in a book about art history .
a guide to art reference book publish in 1969 have 2,500 entry , some of which referr to sery ; for example , there be a single entry for the series of monograph on individual artist , call klassiker der kunst , also publish in french as classiques d 's art , in which there be thirty - eight book . this guide be extensive revise over nine year , and be republish in 1980 as a guide to the literature of art history , intended for person do serious research in the field of art history . another	sort	of write about art be what artist they have write , either about they own work or about other artist . this may be by way of theory , or on much matter - of - fact line about technique or such question as composition . some write by artist take the form of instruction ; in every period manuals on how to do it , whether draw , make sculpture or other technical task be find , though they incidence be irregular , and such treatise be often the work of minor artist , rather than the great ; leonardo be an exception .
moreover , other culture , such as that of africa , have have to wait until even very recent time for recognition . it be literature within the last three century , then , that provide the main choice for a reader . the advice offer here be that a reader should ignore what category of write a book or article may come under , since helpful art criticism may be find in all	sort	of sourc . there be no need to be intimidate by the formality of a staid institution 's catalogue , or to neglect popular magazine ; as for write in various academic discipline , there ought to be no barrier to learn about an interesting topic . the reader 's question of a book or an article should be what function the write be able or unable to perform
academy of art , whether in the west or in the orient , have have list of priority in theme of art , in which there be many similarity . for example , in twelfth - century china , a catalogue of the imperial collection have ten heading : taoist and buddhist subject , human affair , palace and other building , foreign tribe , dragon and fish , landscape , animal , flower and bird , ink bamboo , and final vegetable and fruit . this	sort	of lis be worth know by a reader , who may occasionally notice that it underlie the degree of attention be pay to a theme by a critic . the survey with a theory the last type of survey to be consider have a basis in theory .
a first broad division between type of exhibition need to be make . there be show which could be group under the heading of historical exhibition ; there be mix exhibition and group exhibition of work by live artist ; and there be exhibition in dealer 's gallery , notable solo show . the catalogue which accompany this events have rather different character , for although there be entry for the exhibit work in each	sort	of catalogue , and usually an introduction , historical catalogue often have additional essay . catalogue of major show have also become big and very expensive in recent year , usually through the help of national , industrial or commercial sponsorship . a characteristic historical exhibition may be call something like the age of rembrandt , or shock of recognition ; the landscape of english romanticism and the dutch seventeen - century school ; both of this be actual title .
it celebrate creativity amid doubt and despondency creativity as energy but also as a duty , work to be do by man as it be the sun 's task to shine . i have point out to he that he picture echo the medieval and renaissance formula for st john on patmo write the book of revelation and for the evangelist write the gospel , it derive from greco - roman author portrait . this be not he intention but iconographical echoe of this	sort	do not surprise he . the write go on to make further point about the picture 's element . this example of catalogue contain helpful art criticism could be contrast with many other which be limit to list of exhibition , detail of the artist 's career , and entry for the work display .
an example be the catalogue of painting by nol coward , which be preface by a memoir of the playwright , describe he interest in paint . in markete a sale of rather little - know works , too , there may be some explanatory text . it would be wrong to dismiss this	sort	of criticism as mere sale talk , particularly in grand auctioneer 's catalogue , though there be little danger of such publication be reticent . part of the charm of a sale be that the financial result be in it a sort of critical judgement , reflect even if not defi the taste and mood of the moment . but an auction be mainly a bullish market ; vendor be try to improve they price , and few except dealer be sell on the market 's way down , in order to rebuy .
in markete a sale of rather little - know works , too , there may be some explanatory text . it would be wrong to dismiss this sort of criticism as mere sale talk , particularly in grand auctioneer 's catalogue , though there be little danger of such publication be reticent . part of the charm of a sale be that the financial result be in it a	sort	of critical judgement , reflecte even if not defi the taste and mood of the moment . but an auction be mainly a bullish market ; vendor be try to improve they price , and few except dealer be sell on the market 's way down , in order to rebuy . this bearish tactic do not work as well as in a stock market , for art works be widely disperse , and decision to buy or sell may be thorough unpredictable .
some of the work for a museum catalogue may have already be do before the acquisition of a picture . it may , for example , have be part of a private collection which it be catalogue , especially if the collector in question be rich . in this respect , the scholarly standard of a private collection 's catalogue will be very high , and the	sort	of information which a reader can expect will be the same . the collection will not , however , be accessible as public collection be . in an art museum work can be study at leisure , and will receive attention from scholar and expert of many kind .
the quotation be from an article of 1954 , at a time when picasso 's reputation be very high . heron be anxious to point out braque 's quality , so he trail he coat openly . to suggest , as i do , that georg braque be the great living painter be to remind a contemporary audience , f to satiety on brilliant innovation , frenzy novelty and every	sort	of spontaneous expression , that , after all , permanence , grandeur , deliberation , lucidity and calm be paramount virtue of the art of paint the rival genius of picasso have prove to the world that we age may be epitomize by work which ( show ) he unfaile sense of visual drama , he protean invention and he power of invest he creation with a hallucinatory poetry . heron show in he article a deep sympathy with braque 's work , which , incidentally , be a sort of paint he he be seek to practise at the time .
to taylor , mentor and leader , have die before the group have it first exhibition , but remain classe with he friend . they subsequently develop individual style and separate interest , as be true of many group of artist , but they initial appearance be define by a programme . another	sort	of title for a group be exemplify by der blaue reiter ( the blue rider ) . forty - three work by fourteen painter be show in 1911 at the first exhibition by the editorial board of the blue rider , the publication concern be an almanac which appear in 1912 with a drawing of a horseman by kandinsky on the cover . the second exhibition include thirty - one artist .
mix exhibitions mixed exhibition be ideal for spot talent ahead of the market , as well as be a significant source of income for many artist . the much common	sort	of mix exhibition be the exhibit society , who history be entwin with the development of art in europe since the eighteen century . the show put on in paris at the salon , and in london at the royal academy , be a means of create sale for artist at a turn point in the history of patronage ; as there develope a middle - class market for literature , so there develope a comparable market for art . denis diderot gain last fame as the energetic editor of the french encyclopaedium , but he be also right celebrate as an art critic .
a cynic will remember that research into the opinion - for power of newspaper have tend to conclude that reader expect to have they exist view confirm . if so , the power of critic may be no much than the listing service offer in the paper or on poster , while real power can be find in the organisation of the art market . a different	sort	of exhibition which have have some success in attract attention , and thus newspap coverage , be the prize competition . here the critic be absolve from make judgement of he own by the need to report what a jury have decide about prize . the critic be stand be thereby reduce , and the description or evaluation of the prize works be less than likely to be uninfluence by they new position .
the argument put forward can be intereste in they , but they drift be often towards make the context of the art show very understandable . art politics or cultural history be favourite theme for such reviewer , apart from the spectrum of cognate discipline which may be the speciality of writer who be only occasionally concern with art . thematic article be likely to be find in two	sort	of periodical , general magazine and academic journals , either interdisciplinary or of specialist discipline . valuable interpretive idea may be find in journal of psychology , aesthetics , philosophy , history , religion , sociology , anthropology , even medicine and biology , although this may not be match up with description and evaluation of art . such article may not start with art ; as rudolf arnheim say about he book , art and visual perception , he apply principle of visual perception to example take from the art .
articles of synthesis between art and other subject may include important art criticism . literary theory be at present in demand as a point of reference for wri on the visual art . articles on this	sort	of theme may appear in art periodical , but be just as likely to be find in other journals , on literature , say , or history . what be much likely to be useful in such material be the chance that inference can be draw by the reader , see a similarity in a problem elsewhere with a question in the visual art . as things be : description
this useful explore some of the resolvable question , in particular that of crucial interest to student of landscape and the human figure . one aspect of illusion be perspective , much value in the western tradition . three	sort	of perspective be identify by leonardo da vinci in he treatise on paint , as follow : the first deal with the reason of the ( apparent ) diminution of object as they recede from the eye , and be know as perspective of diminution : the second contain the way colour vary as they recede from the eye : the third and last explain how object should appear little distinct in proportion as they be very remote . and the name be as follow : linear perspective , the perspective of colour , the perspective of disappearance .
paolo uccello would have be the much delightful and imaginative genius since giotto that have adorn the art of paint , if he have devote as much pain to figure and animal as he do to questions of perspective , for , although this be ingenious and good in they way , yet an immoderate devotion to they caus an infinite waste of time , fatigue nature , clog the mind with difficulty , and frequently render it sterile where it have previously be fertile and facile . but when uccello dy in he eighty , he leave a daughter who could design , and a wife who use to say that paolo would remain the night long in he study to work out the line of he perspective , and that when she call he to come to rest , he reply , oh what a sweet thing this perspective be ! mathematical perspective of a renaissance	sort	have not be use in european medieval art , where the size of a figure often derive from the person 's importance , god the father never be small . a perspective may be use which reverse the convergence of line in the distance ; instead , line of perspective converge in front of the viewer , an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator use to photograph . again , in chinis art perspective be different from it treatment in the west .
a perspective may be use which reverse the convergence of line in the distance ; instead , line of perspective converge in front of the viewer , an unexpected phenomenon for a twentieth - century spectator use to photograph . again , in chinis art perspective be different from it treatment in the west . there be one	sort	of chinis perspective , see as in the west from a level viewpoint , but this be only one of three treatment of space representation . it can be identify with po e yuan , when one be able to see from the near part to the furthest part . in this , as in western perspective , the horizon line be somewhere below the middle of the picture .
yet such a comment may need to be make , nevertheless , to point out the quality of a picture . the critic who pay little notice to perspective or other means of represent the natural world will deprive a reader of help in enjoy the exceptional beauty of the natural appearance of impressionist picture , who quality be inspire by scientific understand of light and it effect . in a different	sort	of context , what appear to be an abstract design , devoid of reference to the natural world , may in fact be a stylisation of a person , an animal or an imagine figure . the totem of american indians , the carving of inouk , ancient bronze ritual vessel from china , and many much example can be find through the world and the century . much african sculpture be not in this category , as characteristically the masks and ritual object of africa be very evidently human or animal in appearance .
be they able to look without too dominant a preconception come from the western tradition there be amuse archaeological record in the nineteen century of the inability of even traine artist to record what they see ; assyrian figure sculpture , for example , be recorde as have unmistakable classical greek feature by an artist in the employ of the archaeologist sir henry layard . a different	sort	of description be an artist 's copy of a work . copy be a well - pay occupation in nineteen - century france , since private collector and traveller be happy to have copy of picture in famous collection like the louvre . copying be also part of an artist 's train , practise by delacroix and gricault , czanne and renoir .
at the age of sixty - eight ingre make copy of masterpiece . accurate copy might be make , but there be in addition a category of interpretive copy , where the artist copy that element which much appeal to he . this	sort	of copy be at the same time description and interpretation , the salient point be bring out by the copyist , who gain greate understand of a masterpiece by he work . it be not altogether satisfactory to call a print by an artist on the same theme as one of he painting a description . after all , it be an original work in it .
it be a romantic notion that there be resonance in the natural world and art ; and it be schiller who argue that music , the visual art and poetry always become similar in they action on the mind . the aesthetic experience descri the object be not the only	sort	of description that a reader can expect from a critic . the critic may be will to share an experience with the reader , sometimes only of the circumstance in which a work be see , as might be include in a personality article ; but on other occasion the critic may give a full account of a personal response to a work of art . this then become not a description of the object it , but of the critical appreciation or dislike that the work give rise to .
michael j . parson describe he work in how we understand art . he can introduce we to some american girl and boy who speak up about what they notice and like . if andy think a draw by paul klee look	sort	of funny , he say so . parson have some sensible reflection about how the child 's comment can be connect with psychological theory . parson outline five stage of cognition , which he have base on the scientific work of kohlberg .
this theory of stage in understand art be helpful , and it will immediately be realise that the first two stage fit in with description , the next two with interpretation , while the final stage be judgement . the theory be not so useful in defi the quality or strength of response , and be no help in analys the interaction of response . the theory be nevertheless of a	sort	which can be of real use in a classroom . perhaps the much usual description of aesthetic experience in the last hundred year have occur when the critic have be face with the need to react to one isolated work of art . it be rog fry 's contention that an object , say a bunch of carrot on a market stall , could be view in a practical way as something to eat for supper , or aesthetically .
unlike many of the town through which he have brib he way in he peugeot from the coast , this one be not full of blood . but it be between coup , or unrest , and have late be smash and loote . it be the	sort	of place which will always revive and rebuild , and in such a place salim 's part be to make good , carry on . the country , former a colony , now independent , be control by a black big man in the capital down - river . an atavistic , tribal , magical resistance spread about the bush : starvel rebel be hunt by an army , but magic bend the army 's gun .
at the same time , this hardship be a focus of he attention . the two word carry a note of declamation a note otherwise absent from fraser 's account . glasser 's prose be sometimes declamatory and sententious in an old - fashion	sort	of way , and sometimes awkward ( hidden in the near future , he be to be prove right ) . but it rise to many of it ferocious and grievous occasion . we be in the scotland of tb , pneumonium and drink , in which sex be speak of as a matter of man attacke woman .
hawksmoor speak the word of romantic duality , and be in a number of way a double book . it consist of two alternate narrative , one of which be set in the eighteen century and the other in the present , with the earlier deliver in the first person . each of the two principal actor glimpse he double in pass , as a reflection in a glass , and each stand to the other in the same relation a relation which presuppose , as in many other gothic text , some	sort	of metempsychosis or rebirth . both of this man be disturb or mad . nicholas dyou be imagine as the builder of nichola hawksmoor 's church in the east end of london ; the enlighten edifice of a rational christianity be thereby ascrib to a devil - worshipper , while the name hawksmoor be assign to the detective chief superintendent who , in the late narrative , fret he into a delirium over a series of strangling which take place in the vicinity of the church .
in the second book , a photograph be speak of which show the pull down of a monument to one of the shah ( father or son ) in teheran or some other iranian city . it be hard to be sure about the year the photograph be take , since the monument of both pahlave be pull down several time , whenever the occasion present it to the people . here the confusion or uncertainty be the point of the passage : it do not matter that the particular of the caption be miss since this	sort	of thing be always happen . it matter less and less as we move into an enjoyable account derive from a vocational puller - down of statue of the shah and he father . the shah be equal to this demolition : if we pull one down , he set up three .
guesses be hazard , and be quote from interviews he conduct . a hint of child abuse may seem to be impart by he account of a gothic moment which come about during a walk with she father , at nightfall , in a setting of peasant and forest . ursula figure as some	sort	of hungarian countess who parent be estrange and who be to be estrange from she ominous father . there she once sit in some sort of castle , or not , read , for sure , the literature of romanticism , and grow up to resemble in the opinion of the write 's aunt , the historian c . b . a . behren a character out of lermontov . lermontov , for he part , be a character out of byron , and so be pechorin , the hero of we time in lermontov 's novel of 1839 , one of that people who be fate to attract all kind of unusual thing .
the beauty of the early prose be , in part , a beauty of grace note , the point of sentence , charge elegance and buoyant , intelligent wit . in take a girl like you a great sentence fall like the dew from heaven during one of the scene in amis when a terminally drunk man endure a sexual turmoil and fiasco , be stun by a stunning but not very nice girl . this particular girl , a model , be putte patrick in he place by go on about car : much of i friend have they on the firm , she say , with the	sort	of lift of the old proud head that he could hardly believe have not accompany a limit judgment on villier de lo isle adam . in difficulty with girl there be passage which recall that lift of the old proud head . in silence , the two almost bow almost stiff to each other , behave rather like two well , two something - or - other , think patrick .
make difficulty just so as to be a person . but when patrick say that sort of thing to jenny , he add that she be an exception to this law of nature . she be not , as he put it , that	sort	of woman . meanwhile the also sympathetic but grahamly madden tim be struggl to move into a flat on the row , while suppose he to be struggl to come out of the closet . a third homosexual on the row
the difference yield a political meaning , in other word , and it would also appear to relate to the old theory of the difference between an author who tell and an author who show , and who employ a medley of voice in order to do so . it be a distinction which may in the end prive very suggestive than serviceable : the author who tell , and who can be account something of a ventriloquist , may well , for instance , be much than capable of carnival , and may even be every bit as plural in he work as he dialogic counterpart . but it be possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lie at the heart of it may be successfully apply both to some	sort	of contemporary author and to some of what go before . the status of comedy be crucial to the debate , and we can at little be sure that kingsley amis would not object to have he practice compare with waugh 's , or to be place with he among the monologist of the right . against this monologic amis can be set , by way of alter ego , the modernistic amis of barbara everett 's discussion of difficulty with girl , which occur in the course of an essay on hugh kenner 's fantasy of a british betrayal of modernism , and which spring the surprise of convey that amis , so often suppose an enemy of modernism , be really a modernist .
but perhaps it be not too simple to suggest that we be also conscious of zuckerman as a deflection of the wrath over roth which work by make zuckerman responsible for the outrage . we be conscious of what zuckerman do for roth : when he help a man to gather he spilt heart pill , it be roth help he by assign a small mercy . in the facts , the tough guy with he shiksa , the supposedly self - hate diaspora jew , can be tenderise a word roth like , for all the awkwardness it impart to the operation to which it refer into a	sort	of uxorious submission where he parents be concern . this be a state which zuckerman experience and which he send up . in the fictional conversation about adverse publicity a good mother meet a son anxious to reassure she , while alive to the comedy of it .
i very write become a different adventure , no long the dolorous itinerary of a convalescent , no long a begge for compassion and friendly face , but a lucid building , which now be no long solitary ; the work of a chemist who weigh and divide , measure and judge on the basis of assure proofs , and strive to answer questions . this remark concern if this be a man do not describe the kind of book which run easy to sequel , and which be easy to live up to . nor do they describe the	sort	of thing we be suppose to like very much . the first two autobiographie , that be to say , be the kind of book to which a tradition of literary interpretation have be inimical , imagin for it a literature of impersonality , in which autobiography be subsume , invisible . philip roth 's article refer to this issue in refer to the late book if not now , when levi 's eastern , an adventure story of jewish partisan during the close month of the war , lead by the communist fighter - fiddl gedaleh .
the work that levi valu be of an order to which auschwitz with the lie motto over it gate , arbeit macht frei be buil to be antithetical . in the camps , work be impose on the prisoner with the aim of exploit and of destroy they . it bore a hideous resemblance to the blight , punish	sort	of work which be common in the world at large . and yet there be a work of survival to be attempt in the camp . intelligence , vigilance , practicality , cunn , like , friendship levi be crucially help by donation from an italian workman he barely know , and by the exercise of he skills as a chemist keep you go and , in some few case , make you free .

perhaps do shakespeare spoil you for that , but i think have a text that be good be important . we ought to do much modern work at drama school , as well as the classics . i remember do the stoppard play undiscovered country which be a great help and drama school need to do much of that	sort	of thing . we need to be of now and maybe that be a good way of play then . a.r
k.b. well , i must admit there be a bit of i that thrive slight on the exam syndrome something that get the adrenalin flow rather like first night . a bit gladiatorial , i suppose one might say a	sort	of we and they feel . but get into rada be quite a search process and i remember do four one - hour work session with some of the tutor there , include the principal , before final be accept for the three - year course there . now i think that be the right way to get to know the kind of talent there be , rather than a straight knock - down audition .
one have very little to offer in an interview and one sit there feel rather embarrass . a.r. that	sort	of system be not so easy for actor look for they first job but easy when you be well know . a.s . well yes , but let i say that i give up go to audition well before i become well know through the history man , on television .
the class structure of northern ireland be predictable dominate by protestant . of course , with the development of international monopoly capital and multinational company , additional source of power have be bring into play . but it be likely that the professional who have be responsible for the running of such company at local level will have be ally to the much liberal group among the upper protestant classes , as represent by such family as the o 'neill , who have look to the english public school for the right	sort	of education . walle , bruce , and taylor ( 1986 ) list this mainly land gentry among the cosmopolitan of ulster society . also cosmopolitan in outlook be a variety of traditional profession , particularly university lecturer .
but now , on the basis of a number of well - document opinion poll , w . harvey cox ( 1985 ) argue that the majority in the republic of ireland favour reunification be barely two to one , and that in the island as a whole it be three to two . what be much , cox suggest that support in the south be at good lukewarm . none the little , the characterization of catholic nationalist ideology i have just document would seem to fly in the face of this	sort	of evidence . the general data present by cox be undeniable , but interpretation of the data rest on certain assumption , principally that people act on an individualistic basis rather than as group , and accorde to attitude express in the quiet of they home rather than in response to major event . one remember the substantial surge in provisional support in the north on the occasion of the hunger strike of 1981 , and the impact they have on northern catholic nationalist consciousness , one which cox he acknowledge .

with the first stroke i have already reach the end , say picasso . i grow bore with the sheer size of the glass and have to force i to continue , he wrote . and yet , he wrote , if the glass be to be any	sort	of advance , it will be because of the middle . because it be nothing but a middle , without begin or end . the beauty of glass , he wrote , be this , that the surface do not have to be cover .
first time theme of picture excite i though . do not know why . some	sort	of tension i suppose . what people object to in the end be not god , as i will think , but the suburban house in the background and the garden out of house and garden . taxi then from prado and night train up to lon .
i think you need something on the other panel , above the oculist chart , he say at last . or perhaps just above the arm of the scissor . what	sort	of thing i ask he . he do not know .
i take a photo of he through the glass . on both side . as i look through the viewer i have the feeling , momentarily , that it really be what i have dreame about for so long , a	sort	of crystal ball in which i could call up everything i have ever know . but be that not what the mind be a crystal ball in which one can call up the past
with they have go much of the outrageously condescend theorise express by professionals such as watney mann 's head designer roy wilson - smith , who declare in the early 70 : i want to give the people who use i house a rare and primitive relationship with the raw force of nature . people love to be aw when they enter a pub by a superior natural force a strange	sort	of high masochism . ( quote in hutt , p124 ) the john bull , layerthorpe , york .
already the other tetley heritage pub in york , the swan , be out on lease to an independent retailing chain . moreover , the very same tetley 's who so love restore the fox be now build , in the heart of a residential suburb not two mile away , an open - plan eat barn that contravene all the accept standard of enlighten and community - sensitive pub design . reliance on the brewer 's good nature be a precarious	sort	of dependency , where today 's jekyll can be tomorrow 's hyde . we pub be forever at risk of corporate gimmickry and catchpenny fashion . and not only be the major brewer at fault .

this must therefore be consider as have a detrimental effect overall on the tourism market . language the survey ask firms what	sort	of advice and assistance would be helpful in develope business and be surprise by the low level of demand for language training . it be much surprise that in the tourism industry the necessity for language train to meet the grow demand for oversea visitor be not feel to be important , the report say . there be also very little demand for help on legal matter and employment issue .

yes , but there be not anything in it . i notice a teach job in sheffield that do not look too bad . i keep tell you , anne , that be not the	sort	of thing i be look for . i be still think of go into publish . but as i keep try to tell you , publishing be not that easy to get into especially at you sort of salary level when you have no experience .
realistically , i have no future leave at sis , so what do i do i get up and leave . realistically , i have be apply for the	sort	of job that will pay i enough money to keep i go when i retire . i have only eight work year leave now and with all i saving go , i simply can not afford to work for nothing . if i be not careful , i be go to have nothing to fall back on .
the job pay quite well and i could perhaps at that stage have afford somewhere slight good to live , but i will get use to i new home and i be still keen to try and build up some saving again . the building i be now work in house a number of statutory and voluntary social - service organization . i job be to operate the telephone switchboard ,	sort	the morning post , direct house - caller to the appropriate organization , and that be about it . the telephone keep i just about busy but the potential for job satisfaction in the tasks i be require to do be almost nil . this be , i keep tell i , just a stage post .
goodbye , doctor . she mean it as a compliment but it make i sound like she gp . i make i way up to the lobby with that final two word of she ring around inside i head , and all	sort	of other doctor phrase start to enter i mind people call i doctor streeter , popular song with the word doctor in they and then all of a sudden i start to cry . i stumble out of the hotel and into the middle of the road , narrow miss be kill by a taxi . i remember the screech of the horn and the blur of the car as it pass in front of i .
i buy i statutory cup of tea and sit down . gradually i eye get use to the glare and i be able to make sense of i surrounding . the decor of the place be	sort	of pastiche california : sandy - coloure wall , low - hang light , bright colour pop - art poster and a sprinkling of lush green flowerless plant . artificiality be everywhere . the linoleum tile in the middle area of the floor be rim by some new type of carpet , there be a false ceiling and false blind have be hang on the wall .
yeah like what oh , i have be a schoolteach , a receptionist , a chambermaid , all	sort	of thing really . do not worry , a lot of people come here with funny storie behind they . look , you just hang on here a minute , i want to have a word with katrina about something .
why on earth have that happen they think it be a computer error but they be still check on it . ca not you get an emergency payment of some	sort	not any very . they be cut back on that , apparently .
she be silent for a moment . dorothy , i do not know quite how to put this , but be there something you be not tell i that might help i understand this a bit good . it be just , you be i idea of someone who this	sort	of thing would never happen to . i mean , you have get an education , you be prepare to work , you have get the right background and everything if you could explain very i might be able to help very . it be simple .
until they can find you a council flat . but the day of they be go . there be still some go and you be bind to get preferential treatment of some	sort	. why because i have have to spend a couple of night in a porchway
any job i take would also have to be fit around i travell to and from harwich . it would have all be perfect possible in ideal circumstance but circumstance be far from ideal . inevitable , a	sort	of bunker mentality quickly set in . i be after all survive and that be nothing to be sneeze at , the way thing have go . the saf course of action seem to be to shore up the bunker and make sure i do nothing to upset the fragile eco - system that be support i , for however much we want to disguise it , i have nothing to fall back on .
i be sorry to spre it on you like this but i do not want to get you hope up . i have to sit down again . what	sort	of place be they go to put i in i ask after a pause . a flat .
i sit there try to remember all the detail of what she have tell i . what sort of flat be it what	sort	of a hostel once again , i life seem to depend on the very word she speak . i feel powerless .
well , i say . i do not really know . some	sort	of a flat in harwich , i think she say . she be go to r someone up to find out very about it . somewhere round here
i get up and walk quietly out into the early evening . it be still light . i now need to make some	sort	of a decision . head back into town , i tell i . let 's get back into familiar territory , then we can think up what to do next .
i get up and have another little walk around , finish up just over the road from buckingham palace . what a daft world this be , i muse to i . i reckon that the queen would probably have agree with i she will always come across as a decent	sort	. what be i go to do next i would definitely need to try to find some help from somewhere .
what be you big mistake she ask i . oh , i have an affair with i brother - in - law donkey 's year ago . it be not the	sort	of stuff that love storie be make of , to be honest . do you sister ever find out about it yes , he tell she .
what exactly he tell she i do not know , but that be all in the past now . do you still keep in touch with she no , but we live at a	sort	of peace with each other , which be good . lisa be i good friend until she and andy start go out together we even share a flat together at one stage . andy and i have already splight up before they thing get go , but even so , it make you think a bit .
i sit wait patiently for the wedding to end . it be in fact rather a nice day and i spirit be start to rise . invest all this hope in a girl i hardly know be , in retrospect , highle dangerous , but i be in that	sort	of a mood . jenny reappear soon enough and she suggest that we nip down the road to a little ptisserie she know , which of course we do . the shop have a little bar - type area at the back where people could sit .
look , i have find a hostel that will take you for one night . it be run by a private charity and they do not normal accept referral from outsider but they do not want to be too dogmatic about that . what	sort	of a place be it a convert private house . you will not get you own room or anything but it be free and probably good than nothing .
do not worry , a bit of body - pop will not kill i . what on earth be body - pop it be a	sort	of dance . why , what do you think it be well , you be on the big side and for a moment i have this vision of you
as promise , one of the project worker give i an early shake and i have time enough for a coffee before i need to set off to meet jenny . the girl who wake i also make i drink . what	sort	of accommodation have you get in harwich she ask , as we go off to sit down in the lounge . a little store room i call it i broom cupboard . it be home , though .
that would be really useful , i think . i certainly could . i do not , to be honest , think i would have much success it be not the	sort	of thing that i would have know all that year ago but the idea of ring up a few of i former colleague be just irresistible . now , who should i try first charle howard .
it sound a bit like an indoctrination centre , do not it actual , as far as i can gather , it be just they jargon for a bedsit house . one person live there have to be a sally ann person of some	sort	, but otherwise it be just everyone with they own room but share kitchen and bathroom . if you be vague interested i can arrange an interview with the lady i speak to on they resettlement team , but if you do not like the sound of it i be indeed rather dubious about the whole idea , but we have not be get very far and there seem to be no harm in just find out some much about it .
pool win i enjoy the article on water garden in the july issue . when start i pond , i be overwhelm by the generosity of friend and neighbour with all	sort	of pond plant . now , five year late i pond be well - stock with plant and fish , and i be able to give out plant in turn . each spre see frog spawn follow by tiny frog a tremendous bonus , because i snail and slug problem have be great reduce without a single pellet !
i various crop have compet not only with weed but also with each other , a major factor in the profit and loss account for the plot . pea problem reader have suggest that it might have be very profitable to give much space to fewer	sort	of vegetable , but that would have be something of a soft option . however , another year i shall not grow even a low line of pea along the south border . although they roote system do not interfere with the other crop , the 18in - tall vine cast too heavy a shadow on the plant below .
be ready to open the airbrake fully as it touch down to stop any bouncing or a gust lift the glider into the air again . whenever possible , and especially if you be out of practice , choose a completely clear area on the landing ground and remember to prevent the glider weathercock into wind at the end of the land run . land with obstruction on the upwind side be particularly dangerous and be just the	sort	of error people tend to make when they have not flow for a while . if you be in good practice , it be fun to discover just how accurate you can be with a crosswind landing . choose a line feature along the landing area , with a mark or line across for the touch down point .
yes . what side - effect be there after an iud have be fit you may feel the	sort	of cramp - like pain that sometimes come with a period . usually this be mild and will not last long . you may find that pain - relieve tablet help .

( 1966 : 72 ) recognize such unobtrusive measure have find favour in field - work and i discovere at an early stage that the problem remain one of reveal the structural wart of the system while somehow indicate that this need not be seditious ; and indeed might even be of some value . as it be , when i show close colleague i first work paper ( young 1979a ) on experience in a police bridewell ( see chapter 2 and 3 ) , they be alarm . i be tell on much than one occasion , that i should not really let outsider see this	sort	of thing , even though it be agree that what i have write be an accurate analysis of event . in some respect , i think it be the detail of the ethnographic thick description which much alarm they ; for as almost all of they wistfully point out : it show exactly how we do the business . in effect the insider who question the gross system of classification which define police practice seem set to join that deviant or criminal who contest the system of law and order by break it rule and regulation .
and do not ask i yet . marina , what about you i be still some	sort	of bird , say marina . i think i be a bird of paradise before , but that be in the flow of what never quite materialise that new play maybe i be an owl , watch the other owl screech down on helpless little mice , but i will not forsake i vegetarian principle .

however , many people shout from they lung , with the result that the sound be high pitch and lack penetration . a correct shout emanate from the diaphragm and be cause by a general muscular contraction accompany the punch . wuk o chief referee tommy morris describe it as the	sort	of sound you make when push a really heavy car ; the sound explode out of you , as it be . use you shout sparingly , otherwise the referee panel will quickly come to see that they general signify nothing , and will ignore they . the second way to underline you punch 's effectiveness be to allow it to strike with a satisfy thud that cannot be mistaken .
well , it be not , cameron say without turn . but it could be oh aye all	sort	of thing could be . fair rent . fair lease .
where will it end , he cry out , where will it end ( feel the helplessness in he own depth , know that to the crowd it come as an incitement to great anger ) . the feeling be sough through they , every face be turn fully towards he , feature nake , eye widen ( they be too expectant , too dependent on the next sally , they will must be gather up and channell towards an irresistible action ) . it will never end until we feel we power , until we see how few and weak they be ( this be the mere wishfulness ) , and how strong they be , for consider what they have now , and in what	sort	of a country we be live . the forts and barrack have go up , an iron chain along the great glen , an iron r round the coast you have build it for they , you have clamp this fetter on you own wrist , and i do not excuse i i first work be mend the roof of the arsenal at fort augustus in 1784 . i should have know good , but we be learn now .
how many guns they might turn west along the strath and not menzy struggle to stop the racing of he mind and	sort	out the option coolly . the damp wind blow in at the open door make he shiver and he go to wake the other . in a minute the three of they be huddle in cloak , by the light of two candle and the last glow of the ember , try to think quickly .
she own father , solomon klinitsky - klein ( sometimes kline , who be bear at vilkaviki ; the other side of the family come from vilna ) , be hugely influential there ; through he book , notable he lexicon of hebrew homonym which receive excellent review in north america , great britain and israel when publish , become very well know in he adopt land . another of he famous work be the otsar taamei chazel , or the treasury of rabbinic interpretation , a thesaurus of views and definition which be hail as brilliant , indeed , unique in the sacred literature of he people . rabbi klinitsky - klein and he family have escape to canada through the good office of a jewish agency in 1923 the	sort	move descri by norman glimotsky in he my life , i destiny . up to that time they life have be appallingly difficult , give the savage treatment they fellow - pole mete out to they . insecurity , hunger , constant vilification and injustice be they lot , and it be as exhausted escape that they make they way from europe via liverpool to halifax ( then the much important port on the atlantic coast ) , before final settle in montreal .
with the disappearance of temple - worship as such , this fall into misuse , but a new significance take it place , which would have have particular significance for leonard 's parent and grandparent . at this time the father dedicate he son to the study of the torah or to the rabbinate . there can be no doubt that something of this	sort	take place at this time in montreal , and that it form one of the subconscious input in the grow boy 's development , along with the high family tradition and the significance of he name . moreover , the covenant with israel signify by circumcision be offer to make of the nation a kingdom of priest and a holy nation . , the whole people be theoretically a kingdom of priest by virtue of they privileged relationship with god .
war have be declare , and the fate of czechoslovakia , austria and poland be seal , as it would be for several other country . it would be six year before that anger would begin to subside , six year of unspeakable anguish for that of hebrew persuasion , when unbelievable monstrosity would be inflict on they , by the end of which half of the world 's jewry have be murder . this be careful shield from the grow boy , though horror of a personal , much penetrat	sort	be to obtrude it soon enough on he . the genteel and pleasant routine of life which he understand , despite the lengthen shadow of he father 's illness , be convulse in 1943 , when nathan cohen die , and the family be plunge into loss and grief . masha cohen have always feel an outsider , vis - - ve she much westernised sister - in - law .
leonard could be fastidious to the n degree in complete he own work he have always say that he work one word at a time , and can spend month , even years , in add finesse to it ; he be nevertheless dismissive of anything approache scholarly exactitude , still much so pedantry . it be not clear where this come from . there be certainly an element which high value the propriety of artistic freedom : a work of art must be a work of free spirit , untrammell by rule and regulation , wherein absolute consistency or conformity of any	sort	be out of place . but there also seem to be a much personal element , too . in the favourite game he turn on that who produce such work in a wholly negative way .
leonard be fortunate in be welcome virtually as an equal - into the regular company of such as this old poet . not mere welcome among they , but escort around the country by they to various literary and poetry event , and often present to they confrre as they protg . it be during this time that he be invite to the discussion of the civ/n group , a gathering of poet of the very serious	sort	and to some extent inspire by ezra pound 's revitalise energy , even as it name be cull from he writing who have just launch a new poetry magazine of that name . it include such as wanda staniszewska , jackie gallagher , buddy rozynski ( cousin of louis dudek ) and aileen collin ( late to be mrs l . dudek ) , robert a . currie , yaffa lerner , anna azzulo , betty sutherland ( late mrs sutherland layton ) , and dudek he . between april 1953 and march 1954 they produce the first five issue , meet in layton 's home , occasionally at rosengarten 's , to discuss the thing that matter they late poetry and material offer by other , not infrequently be lead in song by leonard on he ever - present guitar .
when it be eventually find it be almost summer , and another sharp lesson on the ephemerality of life and relationship have be learn . twenty year late he could still recall the event : i can think about i loyal dog bury in the snow , ( death of a lady 's man ) . no one bring up in the jewish faith with he	sort	of european connections could fail to be unaware , or convulse , by the nightmare we call the holocaust . nightmare and night - time anxiety , be a regular feature of leonard 's work , though he do remark to we , i do not think that i be scarr by anything . for someone who life have be live in search of the word , who perceive that a scar be what happen when the word be make flesh , who own that he education begin on hear of the holocaust , it be not a convince comment .
the university authority like it , and readily consent to the use of it name . leonard be a natural choice for the first of the new series , both in bear and background he represent , not mere mcgill , but canada it ; he be according approach . a manuscript of poem be assemble by he for the professor to view ; the intention be ( and dudek be very well experience in this	sort	of work ) for he to take the matter over and see it through to publication . but leonard bad different idea . he have see beyond the excitement of be approach for he first book ; he already visualise it on the bookshelf !
apart from organise he domestic life , stella pullman be a disciplinarian in the old british landlady tradition ( she husband be a former raf pilot who now fly for boac ) . she organise he professional life : she demande to know he daily quota of work ( three page a day ) and ensur he keep to it on pain of leave should he fail ! that	sort	of failure do not belong to leonard cohen , he be by nature an industrious and self - conscious worker , if littrestle ; and so he stay . he get plenty of work do there ; he make friend ; he feel liberate and enjoy he . he even find english girl desirable , a girl call elizabeth in particular .
this pity , compassion or mercy , be quintessentially jewish hasidic ; to such god be essentially the god of mercy and compassion . as against that central epithet of the rabbi , the justice of god , they posit the creative , life - give and life - nurtur aspect of mercy . sainthood and mercy be entity of the much considerable	sort	in leonard cohen 's work , as we shall see . stephen scobie , in emphasise the motif of sainthood in leonard 's write , completely omit reference to this key jewish emphasis , which would have prevent he from some of he much questionable comment , such as the reference to they as social outcast . whether that be so in other society , which be high questionable , be irrelevant .
he introduce i to the branch secretary , forbe , who i find less congenial , much prone to rhetoric , though at he level i daresay it be expect of he . it be pike who put i onto the department 's legal section . i go along there one afternoon and stike i head round the door ; see two man in the	sort	of office you will expect of solicitor box file in neat row and shelf upon shelf of law report . i announce i . illingsworth , i say , special project .
pity . and look at that tree . i be sure they be the	sort	that drop sticky stuff on the top of the car . they last port of call be a large , unmodernised house . amanda 's face brighten as soon as they be inside .
i think you book for eight - thirty , john . i do . they be always behind in this	sort	of place . what would you like to drink she choose a dry martini because it would have an olive she could eat .
i mean , he be say to caroline , ' she will bring something to the table and i will have to ask what it be . i will never see anything like it before . she will claim it be quite ordinary fish cake s , only they go wrong that	sort	of thing . she even make pound cake you know , a pound of butter , a pound of flour , a pound of egg without weighing anything . maggie approach godfrey and say over he shoulder , i make it by the pound cake method .
in the bedroom . i be not sure about they once i arrive . be it the right	sort	of party why not among the coat in the bedroom be a leather bomber jacket which do look as though it could be genuine world war two .
there be some circumstance where for health and safety reason alcohol cannot be allow at all . in some occupation bus and train driver and airline pilot , for example employee be not allow any alcoholic drink during the work day . you policy should draw a clear distinction between this	sort	of rule and a supportive policy to help someone with a drink problem . prevention even if you decide you do not have a problem now , it make sense to do all you can to prevent it happen in the future .
according to this account , the mind - body distinction as we know it be invent by descartes . he it be who conceive the idea of identify mind with consciousness and of claim that consciousness and it contents be radically different sod of thing from body and they property . the mind be a	sort	of arena in which private object be viewe : all we experience be , ultimately , confin to this arena . descartes , so the story go , reach this conception because , unlike he predecessor , the aristotelian , he be obsess by epistemological question that be , question about what we can know and how we can know it . he think that the only thing of which we could be really certain be thing of which we be directly aware , that be , thing in we own mind .
by contrast , the metaphysical question of what the precondition be for the world 's be accessible to think be uppermuch for plato and aristotle . this be explain via the role of form in the world . the important thing about form , in either the platonic or aristotelian sense , be that form be the	sort	of thing that can be think , or apprehend intellectual . there be , in common sense , something close to a paradox which generate the problem of universal . this problem dominate philosophy from plato until the seventeen century .
this think cast the world in a profoundly different light from common sense in it materialistic moment ; and much of metaphysics can be see as a response to it . aristotle be the first to try to naturalize the vein of generality that must structure any intelligible world , by say that form in thing be individuals , not universals . the controversy surround the interpretation of aristotle 's conception of form be unend , but , on all interpretation , he objective be to give form as great an affinity with particular as be possible , consistent with they retain a	sort	of generality which be , so to speak , release in the intellect when they be think . something that be not form , but be only matter , could not become general in this way and could not answer to the generality of the concept with which we think . the naturalistic instinct have be to claim that mind somehow create generality in a sense stronger than that which aristotle allow ; it do not mere release generality from it potential state in matter , but fabricate it .
the purport of that attack be to prive that generality could never be an intrinsic property of a mental content . berkeley 's reason for think this be that he believe mental contents to be mental image , and there cannot be a general image . it never seem to occur to he that a general idea might be an entire different	sort	of thing from an image . idea , according to berkeley , be particulars who significance be explain by say that they stand for the thing they represent . this naturally prompt the question what it be for one purely particular object to stand for another .
but even if treat we awareness of we own mental state as topic - neutral plausible explain why we be not aware of we brain as such when we be aware of we mental state , it do not explain why know fully about the brain do not include knowledge of the nature of experience . topic - neutral knowledge be weaker than , and hence be entail by , full knowledge , though it do not entail it . so , if the blind scientist bs know that v be in brain state b and that b be the state usually bring about by experience of a red object , then he know that v be in some state or other of the	sort	usually bring about by red object . so , if he abstract from he knowledge of what the brain state actual be , he can form the same conception of experience as that have by the subject of the experience . in brief , topic neutrality be invok to explain why , within the materialist scheme , consciousness of we mental state be not sufficient for knowledge of they as brain state : what it cannot do be explain why knowledge of brain state be not sufficient for knowledge of they nature as conscious state .
a rather similar , and equally mistaken , line of think which might appeal be as follow . it might be think that the subject 's apprehension of he own brain be very immediate and very holistic than any external knowledge , however complete , and that this explain the experiential difference between the two kind of knowledge . the scientist have essential separate piece of information , whereas the subject have a	sort	of gestalt . once again , this explanation show a failure to grasp the radicalness of the physicalist perspective . a gestalt be a mode of perception of a group of object say of the dot in a print picture so that they be see as one thing .
i now turn to a consideration of some implication of the cognitive neuropsychology of face recognition for phenomenology an approach to the mind and mental phenomena that give prominence to introspectible phenomena understand as act of consciousness and they immediate object . phenomenologist such as dreyfus ( 1972 ) argue that the level of explanation utilize in cognitive science do not truly exist . the physical brain and the world of introspectible phenomenal experience be all that there really be : no cognitive psychologist have succeed in defi another	sort	of input between this two which would provide the ultimate bit of information to which rule be apply ( p. 199 ) . i favourite phenomenological quote , however , come from jennings ( 1986 ) : social psychologist spend year conduct experiment to specify the exact parameter of a hypothetical motivational state call cognitive dissonance
this be eventually formalize in the weber - fechner law which report a quantitative relationship between stimulus and subjective experience , the sensation increase in proportion to the logarithm of the magnitude of the physical stimulus . a quantitative correlation between the objective intensity of stimulus and the pattern of neural activity be subsequently demonstrate by physiologist record from individual fibre . since the work of s s . steven in the 1930 and late , it have be recognize that , although the weber - fechner law hold for many	sort	of sensory experience , the exponent vary widely ; nevertheless , the principle of a quantitative correlation between external stimulus , neural activity and experience sensation remain intact and now appear to be well - establish . so much for the basic laws . the repeate confirmation of the correlation between the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the characteristics of the neural activity it trigger , and between the characteristics of the stimulus and that of the subjective sensation , have encoura the belief that we sensation be in some sense to be understand in terms of a set of stimulation level ( spike frequency ) in the appropriate sensory pathway .

at the same time he try to determine the identity of the american on the podium . he be keep very busy . when he see the blue uniforms of the new york police , do buddeke show they some	sort	of identification or do he just leave to flash a badge be to risk someone in the crowd remember he face and in the future , on another job , he could finger as the stoolie he truly be . he cover would have be blown .
it would have be easy to nick he wallet at that point . the crowd be full of pickpocket , as i point out to he , and i could have easy say , well , i be sorry oscar , but you know it be one of the risk here . i buy he a red hot , a	sort	of sausage on a roll with mustard . he would not eat it , so i do . late when he be hungry , he eat three of they in a row , wash down with bottle of beer which he say he do not much care for .
we have never before be able to run much than one senior man 's squad , yet now , thanks to cellnet 's back , we will have three to back the elite davis cup squad . each offer slight different and much appropriate benefit to the player , so that the individual have a secure platform from which we hope they will make serious bid for international success . a good example of the	sort	of player who should be a great beneficiary of this scheme be james lenton a tremendously hard worker who have struggle financial and once even have to quit to resort to coach , lewis add . he have be cry out for support for age , and i be sure that this new opportunity be just what he be look for . nigel sear will be take up the role as permanent coach to the cellnet challenger squad , whilst john paish will be work with the achiever squad .
kevin inkster discard the loose chain when he be dissatisfy with the cut it give , but it make he realise that he be certainly on the right line . to that extent the supercut be also on the right line , and have some benefit , but for the serious woodcutter it be limit . such be the waste removal power of this	sort	of tool , that safety for the operator and workpiece must be consider . on a superficial level then , the supercut be the safer tool , slip whenever problem arise , though there be concern about the chain break . however , i find that in many instance this slip action make the disc useless , as it be unable to cut to any depth before it stop rotat .

enterprise inns have sign a five year supply deal with bass and all they pub will continue to stock bass beer . this spark immediate criticism that the mmc regulation require bass to free pub from the tie or sell they have be by - pass . the guardian comment that this	sort	of deal would simply prompt far government investigation into the industry , unless the pub own company be see to be genuinely independent of the brewer . that publican stock a guest beer will lose they right to do so , since enterprise inn be not consider to be part of bass . even the bass list of in - house guest beer will not be available to enterprise tenant .

bree : collie problem : light bulb phobia jess the collie be a laid - back	sort	of hound who spend much of he life stretch out on a fireside rug in he large surrey home . the closest he come to exercise be to open one eye every so often , if someone enter the room , or to open both eye , smile , and wag he tail as he will do on one occasion when confront by a housebreaker ! this extremely lazy lifestyle be one long yawn from daw to dusk .
on anatomy ask raskolnikov , understandable mystify . but svidrigailov ignore the question and start talk about politics . he put in a word on behalf of debauchery because it be an occupation of a	sort	. yes and no . the notebook be begin to pull he into shape with they nb .
even he way of throw he money about , what he have of it , be immediately distinguishable from svidrigailov 's , while with both of they money be the very image of mere impute and therefore reversible value in a loose - end world : you to the right and i to the left , or the other way round if you like . cocoon in false - napoleonic narcissism he read about he own deed in the newspaper . he go in for a	sort	of hall - of - mirror self - impersonation , tell people how he would have do the murder if he have do it ( which he have ) . he crime - and - punishment existence be a process of endless self - monitor : what razumikhm have just say about porfiry also disturb he .

( iv ) the mere mention of the bite in anna 's manuscript record of at tikhon 's variant be enough to pull the reader back into the possessed , and he can not experience the sudden fierce tug of that novel without realize simultaneously that the whole at tikhon 's chapter belong elsewhere , to a different masterpiece . it footnote status in relation to crime and punishment constitute , i admit , a funny	sort	of belonge , as do the obstructive force of raskolnikov and svidrigailov upon dostoevsky 's attempt to give decisive new shape to the great sinner of he notebook and letter and fond creative hope . a negative belong , if you like . but narrative tone be a different and affirmative matter .
the fury , the energy of the possessed seem quite magicaally unconvenant . the slippage principle should make for enervation and a general whittl away . but on the contrary , this world of it be rumoure and that may well have be so follow at once by it be very likely that nothing of the	sort	happen again in the open paragraph be as exhilarat as the challenge of life 's opacity to a healthy curiosity . indeed the overall triumph of art in this case be that the novel walk out into we fact rather than we enter it fiction : a very primitive and absolute form of consum capitulation . dostoevsky have an impudent way of make he narrator declare as a chronicler i confine i to present event exactly as they happen , and it be not i fault if they appear incredible like the son of the house write home about he time on the north - west frontier of india .
this belong to the last day of 1870 , much than a year after the murder in the park . it signal the transformation of the large , lucid great sinner into the man who be beyond definition and self - definition , beyond call he bore , and who action whether he be bit an ear or endur a punch in the face or hang by a well - soape rope explain nothing and nobody . a	sort	of par - down : in i analysis a surrender of the crisis - and - clarity urge , and an unloading of all the consecution of theory upon other , principally kirillov and shatov . and conversely , the same notebook entry celebrate the rounding - out of a comic conception mile away from the original , historic granovsky , scarcely less free than dostoevsky 's ideal of art and lie too deep for tear . he , too , see through i ; i mean he clearly perceive that i see through he
and in observe and judge stepan verkhovensky one become aware that the novelist 's selfadmonition to present he always with explanations have be both obey and transcend . detail of background , opinion , foible , be lavish on he as on nobody else . he peculiar gloate obsequious humour , he	sort	of capricious self - satisfaction lurk in the very midst of plaintive protestation , be descri and ponder . we learn that he begin to pay great attention to he dream . we learn it , though , as a sign of he go to see and we wonder .
stepan verkhovensky have only he to elope with , and it remain an open question whether he will go on endur the indignity of he hanger - on position , or cut and run , somehow , somewhere . he remark to he son that unhappiness be just as necessary to mankind as happiness one of that cherished conviction of dostoevsky that get slip in when we attention be elsewhere . but , as peter immediately tell he father , this be just the	sort	of bon mot to expect from an idler who be be keep in the lap of luxury . such taunt hurt . they be bind to come to something , stepan confide to the narrator ; usually in we world thing come to nothing , but this will end in something , it be bind to , it be bind to !

a quick glance at the seven - layer decision - make ladder of the osi , make plain the potential for querulous technical in - fight over a near - interminable period . where be the adventure in grappl with rs232 , network layer and haye compatibility , however necessary that	sort	of activity be light year remove from the drama of the russian steppe , the pioneer excitement of the outback or the storm - lash sense of achievement that tam the atlantic bring . but this be what it come down to . any high drama that remain be find deep in technical work party country .
argument in anglophone circle about derrida 's possible meaning be usually base on translation , without reference to the french original . perhaps derrida 's much famous slogan , from of grammatology , be il n'y a pa de hor - texte . this can be , and have be , take in all	sort	of way . at one extreme , it be regard as self - evidently nihilistic , a dissolution of reality into textuality . at the opposite extreme , an english philosopher have tame it to a position of common - sense moderation :
i would not advocate a university that would be cut off from society . we know that we have to train people towards a profession . i be against some	sort	of professionalization , but it would be silly to think that the university should have nothing to do with any profession . you have to train people to become doctor or engineer or professor , and at the same time to train they in question all that not only in a critical way , but i would say in a deconstructive way . this be a double responsibility : two responsibilitie which sometimes be not compatible .
there be still many able academics who see they activity as research in the traditional sense , by engage in biographical , historical , or editorial work . but where english department be concern research be very usually understand in the broad sense of add conceptual rather than factual knowledge , which in practice means the proliferation of interpretation . the brighter	sort	of aspir academic be very commonly found mark up paperback copy of standard text in different colour ink than delve in library . indeed , terence hawkes have define and defend what he call paperback research as a proper activity for that who lack the scholarly resource of the ancient university . the advent of poststructuralism have give a great impetus to interpretive productivity , since all the literary text that be once interpret to show organic unity and complexity of meaning can now be interpret to reveal underlie clash .
the experience of read major works of literature can have an overpower effect on the responsive reader ( usually , but by no means invariable , the young reader ) . kafka wrote that a book should be an axe to shatter the frozen sea within we ; eliot say that we should properly find othello or lear frightful . the right	sort	of literary experience can be like a nuclear explosion , whereas the human expressiveness that scholes detect in the humblest graffito be much like the low - level radioactivity that be always present in the natural environment . there be , in fact , a good case for resist the takeover of literature by culture , though it be not as strong as i once think it be . i doubt have grown during the year i have be think about and then write this book , but for the moment i will concede that for many scholar and teacher a clarion - call to defend literature as literature would prive rouse and time .
one of they , as the left disapprovingly point out , be a mythologize version of past greatness which obfuscate the disagreeable reality of the present . certainly there be many bogus image of the national past around , culminate in the dream world peddle abroad by the british tourist board ( though this be , ala , what american and other want to visit ) . but people need myth of one	sort	or another , and the left have it own , in memory of wat tyler , cromwell , the tolpuddle martyr , and the heroic industrial struggle of the past . mythology , however partial , be good than blank amnesium . this current feel for the past might provide a way in adult classes of shift the emphasis from popular modern write to early literature .
it will certainly seem so to the englishman ( as i take he to be ) , who find in the envoi to hugh selwyn mauberley pound 's much explicit farewell to england , as he prepare to leave she in 1918 externality : an externality which , consider what mauberley attempt , be utter disable . this be the same reader who , have decide that the envoi be literary , in a limit sense , be provoke by the word magic in the middle stanza into decide that the term literary become a good deal very limit , for the term aesthetic rise to we lip , and so , perhaps , do american ' and there we have it ! for this	sort	of englishman , externality , to thing english be what any american be condemn to ; and per contra inwardness with thing english be what an englishman quite simply have , painless , as a birthright . from this point of view , the only good american be one who stay shamefaced mute about he english cousin , however many year he may have live among they . the same rule do not hold , it will be notice , when there be any question of englishman talk about american .
and do not this give we faintly indeed , but unmistakable just what we have look for in vain in all the other sicilian allusion : that be to say , evidence that when pound be in sicily he do not go around with he eye clos , he ear and nostril stop for that sure be the disconcert , downright depresse , reflection that this sorry catalogue must leave we with . sicily for pound never but once have any existence that be not either verbal ( as in the wordplay on trinacria or the eleanor ) , or else notional , ideological ( as provide a	sort	of slender mnemonic crutch for a tendentious reading of history ) . the contrast with yeat be instructive , and it do not work in pound 's favour . the effect of the sicilian experience on yeat be dispute by yeat scholar , but it be general agree that some effect there be .
true enough , but how easy this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who attempt to deal with thing that matter must be a bore , that rather than run the risk of talking nonsense one should play it safe and stick to charm trifle . this , remember , be w . h . auden , who for many year some people in england have regard as he too anxious not to bore , too anxious always to amuse . if this suggest that there be other sort of english people than the	sort	auden have in he sight , on the other hand it lend point and force to he censure of beerbohm , and of what beerbohm stand for in english life . auden go on : as it be , he sly suggest that minor artist may look down they nose at major one and that important work may be leave to person of an inferior kennel , like the russian , the german , the american , who , poor dear , know no good .
we may even feel , as certainly i do , that some of the late canto be of such a nature that it be hard to conceive in any age of a way of encounter they other than the way we be here embark upon . and yet we need to remember pound , i think , would have want we to remember what a latecome development this be in the relation between a poet and he reader , how recent this be , and , in the perspective of history , how bizarre . we may sure placate the shade of max beerbohm sufficiently to acknowledge that the danger we run in approach poetry this way be indeed the danger of one	sort	of professionalism specialize and therefore blinker , inflexible , and humourless . i suspect that pound be rueful at good when he look down and see we industriously annotat out of sir edward coke canto 107 , without notice that the english language be in that canto handle with none of the sensitivity that would make that labour worthwhile . what i be say be that a lot of the common english objection to ezra pound have substance , and would be worth take serious , if only we could be sure that they be advance in good faith , in humility , and with compassion .
moreover pound 's anti - semitism , late so notorious , certainly cast a sinister light on he readiness to broach this issue . yet this matter , it have be suggest , lie deep indeed , unutterable deep in every american psyche ; and it be good that from time to time the unutterable be utter it be , one might say , one of the thing that we look to poet for . there can be little doubt for instance that the doubtfulness or downright hostility feel towards eliot by some american , particularly in recent decade , derive from the	sort	of american eliot be and remain , long after he have take british citizenship . eliot hail from st louis , but the eliot there seem to have regard they as bostonian and unitarian missionary to that mid - western philistia . the poet do not share this sense , he active dislike it , but he could not escape not even in europe from what he see as the balefulness of that inheritance .
and if pound so blithely overlooks that difference , do not that mean that we have in he a critic who attend to form , to style , at the expense of what that form and that style be use so as to convey do not we have in he a formalist , in fact an aesthete this be the brickbat that have be throw at pound from the first , and be throw at he still , because of he unswerve attention to what make poetry poetry , and not some other	sort	of discourse versify . it be the accusation , or the selfaccusation , that pound wrestle with in hugh selwyn mauberley , and settle not wholly to he own or any one else 's satisfaction . in the hard and soft in french poetry pound confront the issue very early , and deal with it to i mind conclusive .
much intereste will be the presence of mikhail gorbachev , who reform be view with disapproval and alarm in east berlin . also attend will be poland 's president , wojciech jaruzelski , consider by east germany as one of communism 's sounder son who have go lamentable astray in hand pow over to non - communist . a different	sort	of jamboree , arguable of great use to mankind , kick off in oslo on thursday , when the nobel peace prize be announce . one of the candidate this year be the entire population of peking , apparently in keep with the tradition of off - beat nominee for the prize . the 1989 awards be each worth 300 , 000 , 20 per cent much than last year , due to particularly good return on investment make by the nobel foundation .
the successful be always tempt to regard they success as a sort of blesse or reward for righteousness . this can lead to judgement be make about the unsuccessful , the unemployed , the poor and the unintelligent which be both uncharitable and untrue . i be think of the	sort	of attitude that suggest the unemployed do too little to help they , that if only you have determination and drive you can get on in the world . he say there be positive factor in the new atmosphere between local authority and private enterprise , but it hardly touch on the problem of poor housing , lack of amenity and the continuing unemployment . this problem be what lead to that sense of be leave out , of isolation and despair , which in turn can lead to the symptoms we be familiar with drug and alcohol abuse , crime and vandalism , debt and family break - up .
on friday , mrs grant will pick up the 1989 captain of industry award from the livingstone industrial and commercial association . she will be the first woman in the award 's 10 - year history . chosen as businesswoman of the year in 1986 , mrs grant be no stranger to this	sort	of publicity . even so , she seem particularly chuff . it place i alongside such distinguish past captain like sir monty finniston , sir campbell adamson and sir matthew goodwin ' she say .
nor be there any need to risk be challenge by alternative social vision , to attend to the view of every crackpot messiah round the world , since it matter very little what strange thought occur to people in albania or burkina faso , for we be interested in what one could in some sense _ the common ideological heritage of mankind . just so might the exhausted arrogance of a die empire have express it on the lip of a roman senator wave away the news of a crackpot messiah among the jew , and the strange thought that occur to people in jerusalem or galilee . it do occur to fukuyama that religion might have some	sort	of unease to express with all this , but he appear to conceive of religion under only two mode . on the one hand , there be fundamentalist counter - ideology , such as the islamic theocratic state . this , it be to be assume , he liberal reader may take serious as a threat , but hardly as an option .
this , it be to be assume , he liberal reader may take serious as a threat , but hardly as an option . and on the other hand , there be less organise religious impulse , religion as individual preference . this he know can readily be accommodate as yet another	sort	of consum commodity , within the sphere of personal life permitt in liberal society . but there be no need to look to crackpet messiah or fundamentalist theocracy to find a decisive religious rejection of fukuyama 's reading of human history . for he , the energy drive history have be derive from the interplay between external force , conflict vision of the right order of society .
the skin not waxy , but translucent ; the texture not oily , but clean and dry . it still look like a foot , but a very nice foot really . affect nonchalance , i plike it up , and begin nuzzl ; and , yes , it be a fairly reward	sort	of thing to eat . not much flavour , but a fibrous - to - spongy chewiness which set it apart from the average savoury snack . now for the sheep 's eye .
china maintain the same profess intention . the basic law will still be enact , promise a panoply of right and freedom for 50 year beyond 1997 . but the chinese constitution contain all	sort	of promise , too so many that it could probably have be construe to forbid the people 's liberation army from shoot dead hundred of unarmed civilian , and to prohibit the arbitrary arrest , summary trial or execution of thousand very . tiananmen demonstrate what many people in hong kong well know , but prefer not to admit : that the leader of the chinese communist party can and will do absolutely anything , however brutal and illegal , to far they grip on power . the notion that they will be circumscri by a joint declaration or a basic law , so confidently advance in 1984 , now seem like a distant dream ; 1997 , by contrast , sudden seem very real , and very close .
today they make up a sad string of tarnish bead , from bombay , calcutta and rangoon to saigon ( now ho chi minh city ) , hanoi and canton . the city which become the much depresse ghost of it former self be shanghai . although it harboure the bad	sort	of poverty , inequality and exploitation during the 1930 and 1940 , not little because it bright light attract million from the surround countryside , it seeth with exuberant life and economic activity . then , under mao tse - ting 's triumphant communist in the 1950 and 1960 , it decline into a depresse , monochromatic shell of it former self . today , the spectre of shanghai 's past haunt the hong kong 's future .
much to they chagrin , the woe of chancellor kohl 's centre - right coalition have yet to produce a solid wave of support for the social democrat . successive state election have see the governing party pummell by a dismay electorate . but the spd , instead of exud the	sort	of assurance suggest that the general election in december next year belong to it , struggle to hide it edginess . the party react with unnecessary embarrassment and defensiveness to governmend attack on general talk it have be hold with the greens , and it desire , as part of it traditional ostpolitik , to press on with contact with the communist party in east berlin despite the sudden surge of open opposition to the government by east german citizen . two impressive victory this year , in berlin and in frankfurt , produce municipal coalition with the greens , be a fillip for party morale .
the difference in we electorate be much big than for the conservative party , say heidi wieczorek - zeul , a member of the party praesidium . tactically to combine the interest of a miner and an environmentalist just do not work . it can only be do with conviction , with the	sort	of approach we use in 1969 with ostpolitik . today , ecological and woman 's issue be the equivalent of ostpolitik for we . the party leader , han - jochen vogel , a rather uninspir figure , have nonetheless prove adeep at manage this delicate evolution which , bold than anything the labour party ever contemplate , have avoid the sort of fratricidal bloodlett which ravage it british counterpart .

pyrah 's winn partner be qualify for the top competition here but , because of he youth , the ride intend to use he with discretion . the 2, 000 which andy austin collect , by finish fourth on elusive and sixth on zobia , be considerable much than the meagre 240 he won when rid river hill to victory in yesterday 's first leg of the grade a championship . it be very hard work for that	sort	of money and i consider it an insult , austin say of the earlier award . if he win the next two leg , today and tomorrow , he total prize money as overall grade a champion will only amount to 970 but he will have the opportunity to compete at wembley for the rest of the week . . new zealand 's olympic gold medallist , mark todd , have accept a last - minute ride for today 's work hunter championship .

retir mb group chairman dr brian smith say yesterday that any short term dilution in the company 's earning would be minimal . the impact on mb group 's balance sheet of acquir sizeable goodwill in both abs and caradon be mostly offset by the issue of 150m we prefer stock and a handy 80m revaluation of it cmb stake to leave pro forma gear at 24 per cent . this suggest that the next mb group foray will require fresh equity of some	sort	but investor may not find that too alarm . view from city road : flirtatious deloitte by simon pincombe
he have say that the 15m on offer be either too little or too much too little to pacify the banker if eagle be in trouble but if the group could be turn around a recapitalisation would not be need . mr fitton yesterday make clear that he have always be act in an independent capacity in the offer for eagle , and that it have no connection with braithwaite . whoever	sort	eagle out will make a lot of money , mr fitton say . beneath the can of worm there be some very good business . however , braithwaite , which specialise in plant hire , have try to take over samuelson , the film equipment hire company buy by eagle in 1987 .

the 1989 figure indicate a reversal of this trend with 276 death setence pass and a sharp reduction of commutation to 23 . the 1990 figure , provide very recently by the ministry of justice , show a dramatic increase to 447 death sentenc , mostly for murder under aggravat circumstance . the same	source	report that 190 execution take place last year . ai welcome the publication of statistics on the death penalty , as well as current proposal to limit it scope . however , it remain concern that there have be no stay on sentence or execution pend the review of exist legislation .
the immense task of gather , analys and confirm allegation of human right violation from around the world fall to the research department at the international secretariat , amnesty 's headquarter in london . we be obviously not there when someone be be torture or kill . when we hear of such case , we investigate and draw on as many	sourc	as possible to find out what happen in one sense it be very much like good investigative journalism , explain malcolm smart , head of research at the i . the information come to the i through myriad channel , some of they formal over 1 , 100 newspaper , journal , government bulletin and transcript of radio broadcast be sift and other that be less predictable .
this be in september 1989 and he have be in prison since . he enclose a list of the 28 political prisoner still at the prison . a vital	source	of first hand information be generate by the many mission and research trip amnesty send to country each year for on - the - spot investigation and to observe trial , meet prisoner and talk to government official . during the first 11 month of 1990 ai send 68 delegate to 50 country range from jordan to nepal , from the usa to romania . despite the difficultie of get into and travell around many of this country due to poor road , curfew , civil war , monsoon researcher often uncover information and testimony they would never otherwise obtain .
do not forget i dear comrade . rucia . of course , all	sourc	could be use ai as a propaganda tool . we be well aware of this danger and do not blindly accept what people say , state malcolm smart . it come down to apply a judgement base on the background knowledge we have acquire from 30 year of monitor and report human right .
this comparison have faze she , as she only know about lee krasner as the widow of jackson pollock ; so the library visit be intended to check out reproduction of lee krasner 's work , to see if she have to concede that she friend may be right . the resource available to she be excellent ; the library have an extensive stock of book , long run of periodical , press cutting , and up - to - date facility to find relevant material . among the	sourc	she will find be critical review , article , catalogue and book about new york paint of the 1940 and 1950 , which will remind she that pollock dy in 1956 . there be no shortage of wri about pollock ; like other star artist , he have an embarrassingly large number of apologist , but fortunately there be select bibliographie which can guide she to key publication . there may , however , be questions in she mind about the choice open to she : how will the information in a catalogue differ from what be to be find in a monograph
moreover , other culture , such as that of africa , have have to wait until even very recent time for recognition . it be literature within the last three century , then , that provide the main choice for a reader . the advice offer here be that a reader should ignore what category of write a book or article may come under , since helpful art criticism may be find in all sort of	sourc	. there be no need to be intimidate by the formality of a staid institution 's catalogue , or to neglect popular magazine ; as for write in various academic discipline , there ought to be no barrier to learn about an interesting topic . the reader 's question of a book or an article should be what function the write be able or unable to perform
he book entitle the civilization of the renaissance in italy avoid a chronological sequence , since he plan of arrangement be to build up a mosaic of characteristic material . as he explain : i start point have to be a vision , otherwise i cannot do anything . vision i call not only optical , but also spiritual realization ; for instance , historical vision issue from the old	sourc	. a much mundane project for a survey write be to scan western art , which have often be attempt in series of book , many of they , as roger fry 's comment imply , by german historian . a few single volume have have deserve success .
the property of the material make limewood sculpture a special medium . it be a medium of the grand form and of the surface , whether polychrome or monochrome ; it be not a positive medium of the middle form , like oak , or even usually of the assertive instrument , as bronze can be . the grand form offer a scale of much or little assimilation to the form hide in the wood , the surface a scale of texture , on both of which the sculptor play , and they be a	source	of specific qualitie of the genre . a final chapter be devote to four case study : michael erhart of ulm , tilmann riemenschneider of wurzburg , veit stoss of nuremberg , and han leinberger of landshut . this short study be in part historical , but partly art criticism ; the study of leinberger be particularly relevant , as it comment both on an encounter with a sculpture and the problem of read about it .
beyond which , a disbeliever in astrology can find quite other way of categorise artist . a final caution about use monograph about painter be that they can seldo be read alone . historical background be only compress in a monograph ; biographical material may be very extensive in other	sourc	; the painter 's contemporary will not receive much attention , and may be slight . even illustration may not be adequate , detail of picture often be poor represent , leave an artist 's technique , material and handle to be discover from very specialist study . the reader can hope , all the same , that the write will give an account of the special merit of key picture , and it be this art critical passage which can be of many help in enjoy or appreciat the chose artist 's achievement .
van gogh be famous not only for he art , but for he write . he do not write an autobiography , but he letter have be a source of fascination to a wide audience , especially artist . lucky , he have a correspondent in he brother theo in who he could confide and with who he could explore idea about art ; the letter be thus an invaluable	source	of interpretation . from the distance of a century , some of van gogh 's enthusiastic appraisal of the art of he time look curious ; but then , this artist act as a critic be especially vulnerable to admir art with a moral purpose , or work from which he be able to draw inspiration . private letter be like a conversation overheard , often very reveale than an autobiography , or than a diary which may have be write with much than half an intention of allow it to be publish .
it be very important that you read wide , both novel and playscript , and do not just confine you to an exam syllabus . after all , an actor 's life be spend work with word , and it will be valuable for you to have a reasonable background in the english literary and dramatic tradition . novel have be a rich	source	of material for the film industry since the talky be introduce , and it be very intereste to see how both classic and contemporary novels require skilled adaptation of the dialogue to make sufficient dramatic impact in a film . as you read you will probably be aware of a character 's potential as a role for the actor particularly with that who have already an established place in theatrical tradition ( dickens be full of such character ) . read play be an essential part of you career preparation the much play you read the much you will understand of the theatre 's development .
the church not only provide solace and comfort in that long year , but also a vigorous identity which enable it people to hold up they head amy the persecution and oppression . it provide intellectual and spiritual leadership and some alleviation from hunger and starvation . the clergy be the only	source	of education apart from the hedge school teacher ( dowl 1968 ) and provide a significant moral and organizational resource . several aspect of catholicism become particularly important in the nineteen century . as have be see , partially as a result of cardinal cullen 's nineteen - century reforms , the church become very organize and develope in it number of clergy and religious .
one should add that buckley take the christian myth for grant , as backdrop to the discourse . but one must remember that the divergent reading of the christian myth by reformation and counter - reformation be at the heart of the religious as oppose to the rough interpretation of the conflict . the importance of the protestant variant should not be underestimate give the extent of religious practice and the power of religious man within the protestant loyalist bloc and the grave importance of conceiving of one 's position as absolutely irreproachable , depend as it do on a divine	source	. at the heart , or within the innermost wall of the protestant loyalist alliance , be the man of god not woman , not rough , and not immoral be he soldier , clergyman , businessman , or farmer . after the account of creation and redemption , which despite the variance among intellectual accounts in the past probably have slight little relevance as a divider at the popular level , the two main variant begin ( for popular accounts , see harris 1972 ; leyton 1975 ) .
citizen then act as witness in the court and final may compose the jury the real judge of guilt and innocence . in all capitalist democracie there be two source for the legitimacy of the state , namely statehand it and the ideology specific to the state in question . it will be argue that when the second	source	be threaten as well as the first , the power to coerce can devolve on the civil sphere in a substantive way . the conclusion to the argument will be that there be a specific form of violence of a political kind outside of state control which cannot be reduce to crime . the specificity of this form of violence or coercion have to be recognize , however one feel about the terrible consequence of it for the innocent .
it be 1974 before that particular form of discrimination be remove by a new adoption act . tes the alliance 2 : the mother and child scheme controversy the second case reveal even very the extent to which the legitimation of the state be a roman catholic affair , at little as one of the two principal	sourc	of power in the alliance . from the early 1940 , the irish government begin to work towards the introduction of a comprehensive health service for mother and child in line with other legislative developments in western country . there can be no doubt that the lack of such a programme bore heavily upon the poor , and that poor health and mortality be a consequence .
as have already be see , it be the style of both church and politician to avoid they mutual consultation be know , which tell we that the secularity of the state at that time be partially a faade , but one which it be feel by both interested party have to be maintain , probably so as not to confuse the faithful . in a letter to the irish premier in 1947 , while an extensive health bill be go through parliament , the bishop point out that to claim such power for the public authority , without qualification , be entire and directly contrary to catholic teach on the right of the family , the church in education , the right of the medical profession and voluntary institution ( irish independent , 12 apr . 1951 , quote whyte 1980 : 143 ) . it appear that one of the main	sourc	of the bishop 's opposition be the authoritarian nature of the legislation . that the bishop be affect by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme clearly they stand to lose money and independence if such a scheme be implement seem like . whereas similar provision in other country be mainly design to provide facility which could or could not be use , the irish one be to be compulsory and there be to be no choice of doctor .
the roman catholic hierarchy declare that they have no opposition to this particular change , but one wonder how the vote would have go if they have . also , in 1974 , an adoption act make it possible for couple of mix denominational or religious origin to adopt . but roman catholic adoption agency , the	source	for the majority of child await adoption , be not oblige to assign baptize roman catholic child to such couple , and whether they do or not be not a matter of public knowledge . the episode show , as whyte say , not a clash between church and state but a shift consensus involve they both , ( 1980 : 399 ) . a far significant change in political religious attitude occur with the liberalization of legislation prohibit contraceptive to be buy or sell , or even import into the state .
as alan dukes td argue in the dil in response to the pastoral letter : it be wrong to contend that divorce legislation define all marriage as be dissoluble . it do no such thing ; rather it define the circumstance and condition in which a marriage have cease to be a	source	of happiness and streng to that involve and may be bring to an end there be no compulsive power in this amendment , nor will support legislation contain any obligation on that who do not wish to do so to use the mechanism it will set up . ( dil debate , 14 may 1986 , as report by dick walsh , irish time , 15 may 1986 )
there seem to be the fairly uncomplicate desire among the community to see all the child attend the same school , as an expression of relationship exist within the community . it be likely that child have the important function in a new housing area of bringe parent and neighbour together , particularly when there be a lack of other social amenity a characteristic of new housing area in and around dublin in the 1970 . the child probably appear as a	source	from which to develop new relationship and the immediate perception be to translate this experience into scholastic term . the absence of a non - roman catholic school in the immediate area and the nave belief that they be empower in some way to have a say in what type of school should appear on they housing estate there be a small roman catholic school which be to be expand to cater for the growth of the population may have sharpen catholic parent 's interest in have an integrate school . there be at this point no apparent difficulty experience between the majority of estate member and no significant source of conflict , that be until the question of a multi - denominational school it become such a source .

not easy though , he wrote , to submit one to it , to enter it orbit . always the danger of the cold spread too fast , of i not be able to live with it . and then , he wrote , there be the question of why that dread should also be a	source	of excitement . be it because one do not turn to art for comfort for safety
since topp up , rather than full replacement , be the favour option for caterer , the first worry be match up . there be surprisingly few popular pattern of cutlery many caterer use the historic pattern devise in sheffield . the fact that a wide number of manufacturer work to the same pattern means that the caterer who be topp up need not return to the same	source	for the top - up . identify a selection of cutlery distributor , send they one of you piece of cutlery and ask they to match it and send they sample and your back . there will be some difference , but they may be too slight to be notice by the customer , who would normal see only one piece of each item in any case .
he genesis be part of a much long creative process and must be see as the culmination of eleven century of english literary history . though agatha christie be properly reticent about the breadth of she reading , it be clear to the informed student of she work that they reflect a much broader and deep literary frame of reference than be usually admit to this particular author . i essay will trace the pattern of reference to other literary	sourc	of which the author herself be sometimes no much than subliminally aware . though there be clearly classical influence on agatha christie 's work much obviously in the collection the labours of hercule they be not within the province of this study , particularly since the subject have be expert cover by other scholar . it be i intention to trace only the english language source for the creation of hercule poirot .

and fing the fiendish one . though it might be fanciful to assert that this passage herald the arrival of hercule poirot on the literary scene , it be clear that the digression prepare the way for the development of the whodunnit form , and particularly of the private detective , the righteous unraveller , who task it will be to solve the murder . grante that the beowulf reference , though tantalisingly close to unambiguity , cannot be unequivocally accept as a primary	source	for hercule poirot , the directness of the next reference brooks no denial . it be indeed remarkable and perhaps a comment on the tunnel vision of many in academic life that no previous scholar have look for the belgian detective 's literary antecedent in the much obvious of source , the medieval mystery play . the very word mystery could not provide a much heavy clue , and i be bold to assert that agatha christie 's inspiration to write mystery feature hercule poirot sprang directly from she reading of the follow extract from the harrogate third shepherd 's pay in the hull cycle ( as it hath be diver time act by the guild of chandler and gardner upon the feast of corpus christie , ) :

oh perfecte porot , the lyttyl clever sluthe , the clewe wyl trace , and always fynde the truthe . the evidence in this extract be conclusive , and it can therefore be definitive state that agatha christie 's	source	for the character of hercule poirot be speke , parot . but the author 's debt to english literature do not stop with john skelton . in she development of the character of poirot , she be clearly influence by she reading of sir philip sidney 's astrophel and stella , and particularly of the follow sonnet :
till he spoffer will who doon tha ' ca ' the burgy tae the boggin , c . i have now supplie sufficient evidence of agatha christie 's erudition and remarkable range of	source	- material to silence the much sceptical critic of i thesis . and i think i should definitely be award i doctorate as soon as possible . osbert mint , april 1967
it have be , i realize , an extremely long and tir day . i decide to abandon i early plan of just walk around until dawn and instead to try and find somewhere where i could get some sleep . i have , as i have say , hardly any money leave , so with no new	sourc	of income on the horizon , the sensible thing to do be to sleep rough . i leave the station and start down the road to harwich town . a little way along , i see a path run up the bank to i left and on the top of this bank there be a rather eccentric mock - gothic porchway .
the memory of that few hour be etch on i mind . they be typical of part of what it be like to be homeless have nowhere to go ; have to avoid all representative of authority ; feel tired and generally run - down ; and need to have i wit at they sharpest at a time when they have become critically undernourish . people of all shape and size become i big threat and a vital potential	source	of assistance . and there be all that seemingly interminable , lonely hang around . feel conspicuous embarrass about i very existence but resentful of what have happen .
in a small garden two excellent weep ornamental and habitat shrub , the kilmarnock willow , salix caprea pendula , and cotoneaster hybridus pendulus , make ideal tree up to 10ave high . in spre the willow , with it arch branch , embroider with silver female catkin , be truly a thing of beauty . the caterpillar so far unidentify , which feed on it leaf provide an abundant	source	of protein for the many young bird . birds be bowl over cotoneaster hybridus pendulus be , in wildlife terms , what ian botham be to cricket in the allrounder class for usefulness .
rowan will grow in alkaline soil , but prefer heavy acid loam . a valley i know have rowan tree grow with oak , birch and holly . in winter it be a wildlife haven ; even in the harshest weather it afford a rare faile food	source	. since ancient time , the rowan tree have be consider a scourge to witch . cattle wear collar of rowan wood to protect they from spell and curse .
this prevent nitrate be wash out of the soil in winter . when the manure ret down they add organic matter to the soil , which turn into humus . this be not only a	source	of plant food , but also encourage earthworm activity . the two together make poor , dry soil much moisture - retentive , and improve the drainage in heavy soil . plant with a fibrous root system , create plenty of organic matter , do much to improve the soil structure .

ever dug up a bed of apparently flourish potato , only to find the tuber riddle with hole where the slug have be at they the major culprit be the keeled slug , dark grey or black with a distinct ridge down it back , which live mostly in the soil . slugs turn to the potato crop in late summer , when other food	sourc	be disappear . once start , there be little you can to to stop they , and the damage increase great in september . a good solution be to harvest the crop early in september , store the tuber out of harm way .
plant pest be herbivore , eat foliage or suck the sap , while predator be carnivorous and live by feed on plant pest , directly or by laie they egg among colony so that they larva have a ready supply of food . the common predator be ladybird , hoverfly , lacewing , ground beetle , centipede and insectivorous bird , together with frog , toad and hedgehog . attract bird to the garden by feed they when they natural	sourc	of food be scarce ; grow plant favoure by insect predator ( like limnanthes , cornflower , eschscholzium , aster , chrysanthemum , robinium , philadelphus and spiraea ) , and respect the habitat of retir predator such as beetle , frog and bat . treatment a major infestation be almost certain to occur at some time or other , and you must then decide how to control or eradicate it .
they elongate stem with few small leaf strive upwards until they find sufficient light , and this can be see when sun - love specy be plant in shady part of the garden . similarly , congested seedling will become thin and draw , with soft , weak stem that eventually collapse from be force . and where the	source	of light come mostly from one side , as when plant be grow under a hedge , stem often bend and stretch in that direction . the tendency to move or grow towards light be call phototropism . for this reason , when tackl the problem of gardening in the shade it be important to choose plant proficient at extract energy from limit sunlight .
after a little much fly experience , beginner 's eye interpret what be happen to the aircraft and the alarm signal be no long send on to the brain . for example , as the stick be move forwards a little , the eye see the nose of the glider move down , and the brain expect the sensation and understand what be happen . as there be no cause for alarm , the brain suppress the sensation at	source	. this be another reason to start off any fly trai by emphasise visual reference instead of the instrument . if the reduce g occur because the air be turbulent , there be no visual sign of what be caus the sensation .

although this conference comment be now well over fifteen year old it still holds good . in 1987 when i attend the intermediate command course at the police staff college with some thirty - five other superintendent from around britain , i find that i ph.d . be the	source	of extreme curiosity and even some apprehension , and i watch ( and record fieldnote ) as i new colleague spar warily with the doctor in they midst . i realize i would need to convince they at the first opportunity that i be primarily a practical policeman and not an academic ; and i also note that while the college be keen to list the academic qualification of that on the course , the participant quickly justify lewis 's assertion by play they down to emphasize they history of praxis and practical mastery . an anthropology of the self : participant observation or espionage
the vast library on police matter be clearly under - use and there be obviously a need for a critical ethnography of the college it , for it take in number of senior and middle police manager each year , maintain a considerable staff of academics and visite lecturer , but have singularly fail to provide an academically stimulat university of policing . even the civilian academics at the college seem to be nullify by the overrid police desire for circumspection in the write account and the preference for academic silence . it could be anticipate that the college would have see the creation of a continuous stream of book and paper generate by the rich	source	of material which pour through it gate , but this have hardly be the case . two book in the recent past ( pope and weiner 1981 and thackrah 1985 ) both contain veil indication of the problem this civil service academics encounter when they write about the police . in a forward to modern policing ( pope and weiner ibid . ) ,
this point ( wojta 1982 ) occur in a description of a new research centre for police study at strathclyde university , which be to ask whether anyone be do research on the police , what degree of co - operation they have meet and to encourage research by the police they . once again , however , defensiveness win the day and when the strathclyde centre circulate force ask they to co - operate in the venture , a decision be take to withhold co - operation and a circular go round to this effect , suggest the exist home office fund prsu ( police research service unit ) and the home office research and plan unit be adequate for the need of the service . this latter unit ( former the ho research unit ) do provide some research material for that who seek it out and it bulletin be a reference	source	to recend government fund research , which be large concern with operational system and the tool of policing . however , i have never see a copy of this circulate at the subdivision level at any location i have work ; and outside force hq the availability of any research or analytic literature on police fall off dramatically . ho circular ( 194/78 ) describe british and american research literature on policing be another typically apologetic , anti - intellectual document , for within it first few paragraph it admit :
the derogatory phrase he be not a real poli ; he will never be a poli as long as he be get a hole in he arse quickly set out marker to define who be one of we and who be not . we be thief taker , while other outside be exclude , perhaps to be dismissive descri as mere uniform carrier . dougla ( 1966 : 1973 ) have descri how the boundary which lie between the structure of holiness and the anti - structure of pollution be potential power base and always the	source	of emotive reaction . such relative position be clearly set out for i in chain of metaphoric relevance , with real polise large symbolize by the use of the body and it social and physical space . each link in the chain express a perceive correct place and tie this into an all - encompass behavioural ideology which in turn determine we action .
be the predecessor of structure . it be the pre - intellectual awareness that give rise to it . we structural reality be pre - select on the basis of value and really to understand structure reality require an understand of the value	source	from which it be derive . one further consequence of attribut pre - eminence to quantity in relation to detection rate mean that the prig who clear he slate ( admit to lot of crime , no matter how trivial ) become a prize catch , simply because he help the figure . he arrest , as i have suggest , will often be make by a uniform poli who physical handling of the body ( the person apprehend ) will be temper by an acute awareness of the need to maintain physical domination .
we live in hope , say jay . the first exhibition meet be at lucy 's flat . where they rough out the area they could cover , and possible	sourc	of material . lucy want a pamphlet by way of introduction ; jay say , let we just get all the information together . lucy have borrow the office word - processor .
thus the advance be make a split second after discern the opponent 's attack . however , that of a much robust spirit will thrust directly into the opponent 's attack , stak all on a combination block and counter . actual , provide you time be reasonable , this be not too dangerous , because you will be interrupt the attacking technique close to it	source	, when it be at it weakest . reverse block for this type of block you slide diagonally forwards so that the angle of you advance take you clear of the opponent 's front kick .
but they will not ask i . they do ask he , however , and they come in hundred for the purpose . he feel he have scarcely fall asleep , he be dreame of a black river , with no bank , yet there be something there , a	source	of light that he want to reach , which he could not reach against the cold drive of the current he wake in a sweat voice a dog bark . someone enter the room and he recognize allan stewart 's voice .

5 . perhaps the good place to begin read piaget in the original be piaget and inheld , the psychology of the child . piaget 's the child 's construction of reality ( 1955 ) be probably the good	source	of the constructivist thesis . boden have write an excellent shod introduction to the theory . piaget be not the only constructivist .
sugar be positive detrimental to bodybuild due to the fact that it caus a rise in insulin level . intensive train routine cause the release of grow hormone from the pituitary gland , but insulin can block the release of this hormone and thereby nullify the effect of training . the	source	of energy for a muscle contraction be adenosine triphosphate ( a.t.p . ) and this occur in very small amount in human muscle . therefore , it need to be rapid regenerate if exercise be to continue , and this regeneration be bring about by a substance call creatine phosphate ( c.p . ) . the split of the a.t.p . and cp molecule be the prime source of muscular energy .

this include source for information on noise and fire , as well as advice on the law and occupational health . conserve matter step be at last be take to create a formal structure for check the	sourc	of sustainable manage tropical timber . if all the claims of timber merchant and supplier be to be believe , much tropical timber sell in britain be already produce on a sustainable basis . however the worldwide fund for nature ( wwf ) have say that less than one per cent of all tropical timber bring into britain be manage sustainably .
the council sill be an umbrellum organisation to provide an infrastructure for other group to monitor for management , and the fsc will be promot the standard through a for stewardship charter . the fsc be currently in the draft stage , with proposal be present to conservationist in britain and the usa . in america the rainfore alliance and green cross be attempt to monitor sustainable	sourc	but the two organisation have complimentary skills , and will benefit from a coordinat body which will hopefully be able to make much efficient use of the many diverse group work on rainfore practice . the draft proposal for the fsc be open to further discussion and suggestion of aim and objectif be welcome through the page of woodworker . workshop manual
he be , however , frequently contact by landowner who want to know how they can make good use of they tree . now , as a step away from the craftsman entrepreneur that have be john makepeace 's hallmark he have introduce a new course to hooke park college for manufactur business that want to make good use of wood . he be attempt to provide training for people who want to create business that produce quality product from indigenous timber at	source	. like he other course this one - year programme will comprise a mix of practical and business study , though the practical side be very likely to look at machin , timber technology and forestry . it be hope that the first year 's crop of student will stay on at hooke park to help initiate a production plant there .
as we progress up the scale of profit - take , we find other who sell at small craft fair and that who find an outlet through local shop , until we come at last to the favour few who sell at the prestigious craft fair which hugh prefer . but no matter how we dispose of we good , we be not in woodturn to make a living . hugh chide we for sell at what he regard as low price , but he forget that we hobby not we	source	of income ; it be a way of relax during evening and weekend when the serious business of ear a living be over . we might even feel that any financial loss be a small price to pay for the satisfaction which woodturn bring . this be where we differ from the professional they turn in order to earn ; we earn in order to turn .
nevertheless , some flat pattern work can be fairly treat as marquetry , much often base on natural form . it can vary from single unit to repeat and form border to all - over effect . though it do not , in general , exemplify , the uniqueness of marquetry ( achieve by use the wood grain as the	source	of the visual effect ) it can be intrigue in spite of what i imply early about the limitation of the silhouette as a design form . where problem do arise over cut out narrow strip which we have meet before it be sometimes good to cut in the background piecemeal , glue in each subsection of background separately as you go along . for the roundel pattern ( fig . 2 ) , a cutt sequence be suggest .
it seem that the third law of aerodynamics be especially at work in this case . ( the third law of aerodynamics state quite clearly that what ever you do you be knacker ) . incidentally i get that information on the third law from a very reliable	source	. frank be a retired boffin i think from british aerospace . he come here five or six year ago on one of we short cours to learn veneer .

not surprise , the department of transport , and in consequence the british railway board , maintain a policy of aim to reduce the pso so as to reduce the demand on the taxpayer . nationalised industry be first set annual cash limit under a labour administration , but the concept be in line with conservative government policy to cut direct taxation and release cash so that people ( voter ) have a great choice with what to do with they money . john welsby be appoint as the first director , provincial , and he set about evaluat the	sourc	of the sector 's cost . quite clearly , as cost be four time direct revenue , 10 per cent ( for example ) save in cost have much much effect on the balance than do a potential 20 per cent increase in revenue , so energy wa at first concentrate on the cost base . a significant feature be the realisation that br 's policy to refurbish and life - extend the age fleet of diesel multiple unit involve an enormous additional expense in the sudden requirement to extract all they blue and white asbesto .
